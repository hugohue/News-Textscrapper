            "url:  https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/5/21125576/kirk-douglas-died-obituary-michael-spartacus\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "The venerable and celebrated actor Kirk Douglas, who starred in more than 80 movies and was nominated for three Oscars, has died. He was 103 years old.\n",
            "Douglas was one of the last living legends of Hollywood’s Golden Age, known for roles in movies such as the early Stanley Kubrick films Path of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960); Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957); Lonely Are the Brave (1962); and Seven Days in May (1964). His Oscar nominations came for roles in Champion (1950), The Bad and the Beautiful (1953), and Lust for Life (1957), and though he didn’t win, he received an honorary Oscar in 1996.\n",
            "Along with these roles, one of his most iconic and memorable performances was in Billy Wilder’s 1951 film Ace in the Hole, a film that today seems prophetic in its anticipation of how spectacle and scandal would one day drive media and news. Douglas played Chuck Tatum, an unscrupulous reporter looking to fight his way back into the spotlight by manipulating coverage of a man trapped in an Albuquerque, New Mexico, cave.\n",
            "Related\n",
            "Douglas also starred in the 1963-64 Broadway production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, based on Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel. He also optioned the play but never managed to make it into a movie. Eventually he gave the film rights to his eldest son, actor Michael Douglas, who produced the Miloš Forman-directed movie. It won Best Picture in 1976.\n",
            "In addition to being one of the leading actors of his time, Douglas was an activist, particularly during the Hollywood Blacklist era. His company produced Spartacus, which was written by Dalton Trumbo, the screenwriter who, at the time, was blacklisted as one of the Hollywood Ten. In a daring move, Douglas publicly announced that Trumbo was the writer of the screenplay — until that time, blacklisted artists were forced to use pseudonyms — and on February 3, 1960, President John F. Kennedy crossed picket lines in order to see the film. These acts helped bring an end to the blacklisting of artists suspected of being associated with the Communist party.\n",
            "In more recent years, Douglas was also a controversial figure. Following his appearance at the Golden Globes in 2018, where he handed out an award alongside daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones, a number of commenters on Twitter noted that Douglas was accused by an anonymous blogger in 2012 of having raped actress Natalie Wood when she was 16.\n",
            "In an Instagram post announcing his father’s death Wednesday, Michael Douglas reflected on the impact his father had both on his family and the world.\n",
            "“Kirk’s life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet,” he wrote.\n",
            "It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103. To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to. But to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband. Kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet. Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad- I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son. #KirkDouglas\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21115704/trump-impeachment-trial-acquittal\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "President Donald Trump is the clear winner of the now-resolved Senate impeachment battle — the question is at what cost.\n",
            "He was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment trial, and he even got his way on persuading the Senate to eschew any witnesses, defying Democratic requests and the overwhelming preference of public opinion.\n",
            "It’s a bit of a strange victory for Trump, whose approval rating at this point in his presidency is lower than that of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, or Jimmy Carter at the same point in theirs. This is the case even while the economy is strong and the nation, while not exactly at peace, isn’t suffering major casualties or threats from abroad.\n",
            "Related\n",
            "Facing a structurally similar situation in 1998 and 1999, Clinton secured not only acquittal but a clear political triumph over his adversaries — emerging from impeachment very popular even though his underlying conduct was sordid at best. Trump, by contrast, is truly skating by with underwater approval ratings and a path to reelection that’s built on Electoral College bias rather than popularity.\n",
            "But while Trump’s standing remains ambiguous, impeachment and acquittal did generate a few other clear winners and losers.\n",
            "To understand the impeachment 2020 drama, you have to understand it from the perspective of the key decision-makers — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the vulnerable House Democrats on whose behalf she’s acting.\n",
            "From her point of view, as of last fall, impeachment was a problem, not an opportunity. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report included clear evidence of obstruction of justice, but he punted on the question of whether that’s what he found. That left a growing chorus of safe-seat Democrats agitating for impeachment, even as polling showed public support for impeachment was underwater.\n",
            "Many pro-impeachment pundits argued at the time that if Democrats unified behind the cause, they’d sway public opinion to their side. Pelosi evidently didn’t buy that. Then the Ukraine story broke, a key group of frontlines came out for impeachment, impeachment’s poll numbers improved to become slightly popular, and leadership got on board.\n",
            "Still, frontline members — and Pelosi — were worried about Republican messaging that Democrats were so obsessed with impeachment that they weren’t getting anything done.\n",
            "The strategy the House took — to impeach Trump, to do it on a narrow grounds, and to conduct a fast investigation rather than litigate extensively over evidence — was built around those political concerns. And if you share Pelosi’s key premises, her strategy worked. She went from a situation where she was facing base pressure to do something unpopular to one where she and her members did something popular and then moved on — even while leaving Senate Republicans to take multiple unpopular votes against hearing witnesses.\n",
            "Lots of people never shared Pelosi’s view of the issues, and to many of them, impeachment may look like a failure. But she achieved what she set out to, confirming her stature as a master tactician whether or not one agrees with her approach to broader strategic issues.\n",
            "Senate Republicans made it pretty clear throughout this process that they were basically indifferent to the underlying question of what Trump did.\n",
            "They listened with equanimity to Alan Dershowitz argue that there’s no such thing as abuse of power unless it violates specific statutes. But then they also didn’t care about a Government Accountability Office finding that holding up duly appropriated aid to Ukraine was illegal. They decided they didn’t want to hear from John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, or anyone else with relevant information. And indeed, despite a fair amount of speculation about possible deals to force Hunter Biden or someone else to testify, they ultimately didn’t explore those ideas seriously either.\n",
            "Their reasoning is easy enough to understand: They were committed to voting to acquit Trump, so a full and extended airing of the facts could only set them up for embarrassment.\n",
            "Critically, Trump got himself acquitted without even a token gesture of contrition. Bill Clinton survived his sex and perjury scandal, but part of him doing so was to concede in public that what he did was wrong. Ronald Reagan survived Iran-Contra, but disposing of the situation involved identifying fall guys and an internal personnel shake-up. Trump didn’t distance himself from Rudy Giuliani, hail internal dissenters for cutting short an inappropriate mingling of politics and foreign policy, or concede that there was any problem with holding up the aid in the first place, even though he eventually released it.\n",
            "This was all fairly predictable to any observer of American politics, but we didn’t know for sure until we saw it happen. Before acquittal, members of the Trump administration had to worry at least a little that getting caught doing something wrong would lead to consequences. And potentially, whistleblowers had to hope at least a little that spilling the beans would lead to positive change. Now we know that none of that is the case.\n",
            "The concern that impeachment would only lead to acquittal and further erosion of the rule of law was aired in Democratic circles before the House acted, and the doubters turn out to have been entirely correct on this score. Still, it’s hard to see any other possible tactical course of action by Democrats generating a better result. The essence of the problem is that almost every Republican has decided to stand by Trump no matter what.\n",
            "Cory Gardner narrowly won a Senate race in the blue-leaning swing state of Colorado in the context of a huge GOP wave back in 2014.\n",
            "Since then, the same demographic shifts that have made heavily white working-class Midwestern states redder have only acted to make Colorado bluer. That’s an obvious problem for Gardner as he runs for reelection in 2020, but during his time in the Senate, he’s done next to nothing to build a reputation for moderation or demonstrate any independence from Trump. The impeachment fight could have been an opportunity to do that, but Gardner once again preferred to play loyal foot soldier and avoid taking any kind of risk. The small-c conservative approach is understandable, but it’s also very hard to see how he wins reelection in a bluish state without taking some risks.\n",
            "Arizona’s Martha McSally and Maine’s Susan Collins benefit from more conservative electorates than Gardner’s but structurally speaking found themselves in the same position.\n",
            "Mitt Romney’s bold decision to vote for conviction only further underscores the extent to which vulnerable Republicans didn’t display any courage or independence. Of course, there’s a reason Romney can be bold. He has a personal political brand separate from Trump and isn’t up for reelection in a Trump-unfriendly state until 2024.\n",
            "Overall, the growing correlation of Senate elections with national politics is helpful to the GOP caucus. But these three specific members are disadvantaged by it, and especially so when party loyalty forced them to repeatedly take unpopular stands against hearing further evidence.\n",
            "This tends to be a bit lost on liberals, but a key point for many Republicans in Congress is that at the end of the day, Ukraine got its aid money.\n",
            "The whole reason Trump had to resort to things like Giuliani’s irregular diplomatic channel and eventually putting an illegal hold on the flow of assistance is precisely that support for giving Ukraine assistance was widespread among congressional Republicans. If Trump’s personal skepticism of the merits of helping Ukraine were a widespread GOP stance, it could have been held up in Congress as a normal policy dispute. But it wasn’t. And then the reason House Democrats were able to find compliant witnesses for their impeachment hearings was, again, that many of Trump’s own appointees felt strongly about the aid on the merits.\n",
            "Contrary to what you sometimes hear about Trump having completely taken over the Republican Party, he frequently gets pushback from congressional Republicans over policy issues they care about. Aiding Ukraine was just such an issue, and the reason the aid was eventually released is that Trump was facing internal and external pressure to turn it over.\n",
            "What Democrats wanted was accountability for Trump’s scheme. And they were hoping, at least initially, to find some allies among Republicans. But what Republican Russia hawks got instead was compliance with their policy preferences — not only did Ukraine get its assistance, but the White House has reversed its position in budget proposals to now favor helping Ukraine.\n",
            "The White House will propose keeping security assistance for Ukraine at current levels when it releases its upcoming budget, abandoning past attempts to slash State Department funding for Ukrainehttps://t.co/oWVQcczneZ\n",
            "This is cold comfort for those whose concerns about this matter was more focused on the integrity of the American political system than the alleged need to fight for Ukraine’s territorial integrity. But you’d be misunderstanding the nature of GOP solidarity behind Trump if you miss the fact that there are ongoing tugs-of-war over the direction of American public policy, battles in which Trump bends to the Republican establishment far more than vice versa.\n",
            "House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff has been a frequent cable news guest for a while.\n",
            "But his dual roles first as the head of the main investigating committee and second as the lead impeachment manager gave him much wider public exposure. And while he didn’t persuade enough Republican senators to call additional witnesses, he did get public opinion squarely on his side. More broadly, across hours and hours and hours of argumentation, he clearly stood out as not only the formal head of the Democratic impeachment team but also its most effective public spokesperson.\n",
            "Given that Pelosi is not an incredibly commanding television presence and the No. 2 and 3 figures in the House leadership hierarchy are even worse, this suggests a potential larger role for Schiff as the caucus’s informal public communications lead.\n",
            "That Schiff’s performance was widely praised by Democratic observers also sets him up well for a political future in the crowded space of California politics. It’s not hard to imagine him running for Dianne Feinstein’s Senate seat when she retires, or some other statewide office, or else making a play for a top role in the next generation of House Democratic leadership.\n",
            "The Ukraine aid scandal happened to be the issue that tipped frontline Democrats over into supporting an impeachment inquiry. But it’s hardly the only Trump administration scandal that raises fundamental questions about his fitness for office.\n",
            "Some of us called last fall for a broader impeachment inquiry that would more or less take for granted that conviction was impossible, and instead simply try to amass a full public record of Trump’s misconduct. That would include looking into serious questions about the president’s personal business interests in Turkey and the Persian Gulf, as well as China and other foreign countries, along with the big-picture question of violations of the emoluments clause and his continued stonewalling of legally valid requests for his tax returns.\n",
            "The Watergate inquiry, after all, ended up uncovering evidence of misdeeds that were actually much more wide-ranging and severe than helping cover up a burglary at the DNC. But that only came about because investigators decided to really kick the tires of the whole situation rather than maintaining a laser-like focus on the easiest-to-explain narrative.\n",
            "Democrats wanted to avoid getting bogged down in litigation over witnesses or the perception that impeachment was all they were doing. And while in principle there’s nothing stopping Democrats from doing more investigations, all signs are that the party leadership wants to focus attention on banal governance issues like a reauthorization of the federal surface transportation program. And even if Democrats do go back to issuing subpoenas, it’s clearer than ever that Republicans have no interest in trying to make the Trump administration comply.\n",

This toll represents a tragic and stunning increase from a month ago, when it looked like there were no more than 50 patients with the virus in Wuhan, the mainland Chinese city where the virus is thought to have originated.\n",
            "There’s still so much we don’t know about 2019-nCoV, including how exactly it’s transmitted, where it’s spreading, and how deadly it is. And that uncertainty is important because viruses have funny ways of surprising us: H1N1 “swine flu,” which was a pandemic, turned out to be much less deadly than feared. (A disease can be pandemic and not particularly severe.) Ebola, meanwhile, was known to science for decades and then behaved in ways that caught infectious disease experts off guard during the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa.\n",
            "Given the unknowns about 2019-nCoV, in the coming days and weeks, we’re in for some twists and turns. For now, many experts believe this outbreak could get a lot worse: burdening the Chinese health system, spreading in poorer countries with weaker health systems, and sickening and killing thousands more people along the way. Alternatively, it could get much better, with new cases and deaths steadily dropping. Here are the key factors that will determine which way it goes.\n",
            "China first reported this outbreak to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019. Since then, scientific reports have emerged suggesting the disease likely began spreading several months earlier, sometime last fall. Either way, this means that in just the span of a few months, the virus has infected at least 28,000 people in China and spread around the world. That’s an unusually rapid rise for a brand new virus. It’s also stunning when you consider the draconian measures China has taken to control the virus, including an unprecedented quarantine of more than 50 million people.\n",
            "And there is the very real possibility that the true case toll is even higher — because China may not have the capacity to find and detect new cases, people with mild illnesses may not be going to the hospital and therefore won’t be counted, and other countries may not be looking for cases (more on that in a second).\n",
            "Plus, there have also been questions about China’s willingness to share data — and whether officials there are honestly reporting the extent of the problem. According to a new model, published in The Lancet by academics at the University of Hong Kong, 75,000 people may have been infected in Wuhan alone as of January 25.\n",
            "So what does all this mean?\n",
            "“The way it’s looking, if it continues to accelerate, we very well may have a pandemic,” said Tony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. There will be more sicknesses and deaths not only in China, but also in other countries around the world, as cases grow from one-off travelers or small clusters to full-blown outbreaks.\n",
            "It also suggests, he added, that “you don’t try to control [the virus] because it’s already everywhere.” So public health officials would move from attempting containment of the virus to mitigating its impact — setting up hospitals to isolate and care for patients, making recommendations for “social distancing” (like canceling public events), and coming up with triaging protocols for the many people who might need hospital care.\n",
            "Of particular concern is the potential that the virus could start spreading in countries with weaker health systems, where officials would have an even harder time limiting the spread than China has. Or maybe it already is. “For all we know, this is already endemic in multiple countries,” said Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “If this spreads widely like the common cold, not even China can control the common cold.”\n",
            "China is an upper-middle-income country with a world-class network of scientists, a reasonable number of health care workers per person, and a robust disease detection network, meant to pick up new outbreaks as they happen.\n",
            "But many countries around the world don’t have these advantages. That’s part of the reason, for example, it took months to identify the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which eventually sickened more than 28,000 people and killed 11,000.\n",
            "Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, says outbreaks in these low-resource settings pose a particular concern — and not only because they’re more likely to be missed.\n",
            "“We know a disease’s [lethality] differs by population,” Omer said. “It’s better when a health care system is more robust and worse when the health system is an issue.” So even if this new coronavirus doesn’t look very deadly in China right now, the same may not be true for countries in Africa. And Africa may be at particular risk given its links with China, with more than a million Chinese workers there.\n",
            "One hallmark of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was that it didn’t just prey on the very young and old; it killed seemingly healthy people in the prime of their lives. And even though the case fatality rate — or number of deaths per person infected — was just 2.5 percent, because the world’s population was naive to the virus, and the virus could spread easily and kill broad swaths of the population, that 2.5 percent meant 20 million to 50 million people died by the time the pandemic was over.\n",
            "With the new coronavirus, “the deaths still appear to be in people who are at risk of dying of other respiratory diseases — elderly and people with underlying health conditions,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. So unlike Spanish flu, the novel virus doesn’t yet appear to be killing otherwise healthy, young people.\n",
            "But 2019-nCoV’s case fatality rate is also hovering around 2 percent at the moment, Nuzzo added in the same breath. (It may be slightly higher in Hubei, China’s hardest-hit province and home to Wuhan.)\n",
            "If this holds, “that would be bad because of the numbers it’s infecting.” In the worst-case scenario of a global pandemic, a 2 percent case fatality could “translate to a lot of illnesses and deaths.”\n",
            "In the past week, Russia, Singapore, and Australia have sealed their borders to China while the US government dramatically escalated its response — declaring a public health emergency, issuing its highest-level travel advisory (which essentially reads “don’t go to China”), and temporarily barring foreign nationals who have recently been to China from coming in.\n",
            "The fallout from these moves is affecting much more than public health; it’s threatening everything from the global economy to China’s manufacturing industry, and even business at Chinese restaurants far from the hot zone.\n",
            "Reports are already piling up to suggest this virus — and the global reaction to it — has exacerbated anti-Chinese sentiment, with Chinese individuals facing new kinds of discrimination. And that’s on top of the reports of food and medical supply shortages in China.\n",
            "Beyond the psychological and economic toll, isolating China could have far-reaching effects on the outbreak response — namely, spreading fear and driving cases underground.\n",
            "“[It] sends a signal to other countries who may worry the US [or other countries] will ban travel and make it harder for them in other ways,” said Nuzzo. And that isn’t exactly an enticement for honest reporting of outbreaks beyond China. In fact, other countries may have an incentive to hide cases.\n",
            "“Right now we’re focused on the disease coming from China to the US,” said former “Ebola czar” Ron Klain, “but soon it could come from other countries to the US.” If countries aren’t reporting what’s happening within their borders, stemming the spread of this disease will be even harder.\n",
            "The best salve for the current situation would be China containing this virus so that it stops spreading internally and around the world.\n",
            "In an interview with Stat, the head of WHO’s Emergencies Program told reporter Helen Branswell that he still believes containment is possible.\n",
            "“That is not to say that the disease won’t get ahead of the Chinese authorities completely or get ahead of the other countries that are containing it,” the WHO’s Mike Ryan said. “But there’s enough evidence to suggest that this virus can still be contained.”\n",
            "Ryan pointed to evidence suggesting the virus isn’t as transmissible as it might seem right now — including the low rate of infections within households when one person is infected, and the seemingly low number of health care worker infections.\n",
            "Relatedly, no country where the virus is known to have spread has declared a local outbreak yet. (That’s why the US government is firm that the risk to the general American public of this coronavirus remains low, even though there are now nearly a dozen cases in the US.)\n",
            "“Right now, it’s clearly an epidemic in China and whether it becomes a pandemic is going to depend on whether there’s sustained transmission in multiple locations around the globe,” said Fauci. “And right now, the majority of non-China infections are travel-related.” If that trend continues, and the virus isn’t yet moving into communities outside China, it’ll minimize the risk of a pandemic.\n",
            "Among the many mysteries of the new coronavirus: We don’t know how it behaves in places with hot climates, such as countries in Southern Africa.\n",
            "“Coronaviruses are winter viruses,” Fauci said. “When the weather is warm and moist, these viruses don’t spread as well as when the weather is cold and dry.”\n",
            "While it remains a concern that developing countries in the global south don’t have the health systems to detect the virus and do contact tracing, “The somewhat encouraging news is that the weather in some of those countries is warm and moist ... [which] favors against the spread of the coronavirus since it’s fundamentally a winter disease,” Fauci said.\n",
            "With SARS in 2003, China delayed reporting the outbreak for months. Then it took several more months to identify the virus causing the disease and develop diagnostics to find infections.\n",
            "By contrast, the new coronavirus was sequenced within days of its discovery and immediately, countries around the world were able to diagnose cases.\n",
            "Nuzzo wondered if this immediate diagnostic capability has meant we’re finding more cases faster — as well as more mild cases, inflating the numbers and making the outbreak look worse than SARS did initially.\n",
            "At the same time, we might learn that the disease, while severe enough to have taken the lives of nearly 500 people, is not as deadly as it seems right now.\n",
            "If more cases are discovered, or even more asymptomatic cases, the case fatality rate will go down. “What I have long suspected is that the 2 percent [case fatality rate] may not be right,” Nuzzo said. “We could be 10,000-fold off in our case numbers.”\n",
            "In the best-case scenario, this outbreak might look more like H1N1 swine flu than SARS or Spanish flu. When H1N1 was first recognized in 2009 and spread around the world, there were major concerns about its deadliness. US schools closed, people from North America were quarantined when they arrived in other countries, flights were canceled. Not only did those measures fail to contain the virus, Nuzzo said, it turned out H1N1 wasn’t all that deadly.\n",
            "“Now we’re still living with that virus — it’s one that circulates with every flu season,” Nuzzo explained.\n",
            "“I am increasingly in belief that we’re in a pandemic,” she added. “When you deal with 25 countries that are reporting cases, case counts that continue to grow despite very aggressive actions being taken — that signals we’re in a pandemic.” But whether this one will look like SARS, H1N1, or Spanish flu is still very much up for investigation and debate.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/3/21120684/2020-presidential-election-foreign-policy-landmines\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "Last week, President Donald Trump loosened restrictions on the use of landmines by the US military in conflict areas, reversing an Obama-era policy. Top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, though, are vowing to reverse the reversal.\n",
            "In four statements to Vox and a tweet, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), billionaire Tom Steyer, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) all say they will scrap Trump’s policy and revert to the Obama administration one, which prohibited the procurement of landmines and their use outside of the Korean Peninsula. Obama’s team chose to continue their deployment in the Koreas to thwart a potential invasion from Pyongyang.\n",
            "The first statement came from Warren, who on Saturday responded to my story on Twitter announcing her position on the landmine issue.\n",
            "Innocent civilians are the main casualties of landmines. This is an abhorrent decision that won’t make America any safer, and could cause untold damage. As president, I will reverse this decision and work with our allies to eliminate landmines. https://t.co/eeGtthsNfE\n",
            "Two days later, Sanders’s campaign sent me a statement on his landmine stance.\n",
            "“Trump’s landmine policy reversal is barbaric, weakens America’s moral leadership, and is quite simply a giveaway to the military industrial complex,” the statement reads. It continues:\n",
            "Our own armed forces believe these weapons are useless on the modern battlefield, and know that the main victims of landmines are innocent civilians. A Sanders administration will reinstate the ban on their production and use outside of the Korean peninsula, and also work to achieve a North-South Korean peace agreement that would ultimately result in their being withdrawn from the Korean peninsula as well.\n",
            "Roughly four hours later, Biden weighed in as well. “The Trump administration’s reversal of years of considered decisions by Democratic and Republican presidents to curtail the use of landmines is another reckless act by a president ill-suited to serve as commander-in-chief,” he said in an email from his campaign. “It will put more civilians at risk of being injured by unexploded mines, and is unnecessary from a military perspective. As president, I will promptly roll back this deeply misguided decision.”\n",
            "On Tuesday afternoon, Steyer’s senior press secretary Benjamin Gerdes sent me a statement.\n",
            "“Trump’s cruel and reckless decision to reverse the landmine policy is further proof that he’s unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,” Gerdes said. “Every day, someone around the world loses a limb or a life by stepping on one of over 100 million landmines. As president, Tom will immediately reinstate the Obama administration’s policy of banning landmine production and will work toward lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula.”\n",
            "And then on Wednesday, Klobuchar’s campaign clarified her stance. “Senator Klobuchar believes anti-personnel landmines pose an unnecessary danger to civilians and do not advance US strategic interests,” a campaign spokesperson said. “As president, she will immediately reinstate the Obama administration’s policy on the use of landmines and continue to support humanitarian efforts around the world to clear landmines and help those who have been injured by them.”\n",
            "Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang haven’t yet responded to my requests for comment.\n",
            "But it seems pretty clear that if a Democrat defeats Trump in November, his landmine policy is as good as dead. Without needing Congress, the next president can go back to the Obama administration’s stance on the issue.\n",
            "There’s still a question, though, whether a Democratic administration would go further than any president before and actually ban the use of landmines entirely.\n",
            "Landmines are a particularly gruesome weapon. If a person triggers a landmine by stepping on it and survives, the severe injuries typically require the amputation of limbs or multiple operations. The International Committee of the Red Cross reports that “war surgeons consider them among the worst injuries they have to treat.”\n",
            "The Landmine Monitor, a watchdog group, says that there have been roughly 130,000 casualties due to landmines between 1999 and 2018, the majority of which have been civilians.\n",
            "That’s partly why more than 160 countries have signed on to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The US, however, has never signed it.\n",
            "So far, no Democrat has committed to trying to get the US to accede to the treaty. That may have to do with the need to get Congress to ratify it, which would be a tough order in today’s Washington.\n",
            "“I don’t think that anyone is under any illusions that Democrats could get 67 votes in today’s Senate,” Rob Berschinski, who worked in the human rights office of Obama’s National Security Council, told me. However, “the president could always declare that US government policy is to comply with Ottawa, even without ratification,” he continued, using the informal name for the treaty based on where it was signed.\n",
            "In other words, the next president could basically have the US follow the treaty’s directions completely with a flick of the pen. But that hasn’t stopped advocates, like Human Rights Watch’s Mary Wareham, from requesting the US still accede to the treaty.\n",
            "“Future US leaders should reverse this retrograde US policy on landmines and take steps to ensure that the United States finally accedes to the Mine Ban Treaty,” she told me. “Demands for the US to ban landmines will never go away until it actually does so.”\n",
            "It’s possible, though, that no Democratic candidate wants to commit to an almost certain legislative failure in a future administration (though they don’t seem to mind when promising the moon on health care). But failing to commit to accede to the treaty still sends a signal that the US may never promise to stop using landmines in war.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/4/21123008/iowa-caucus-live-results-2020\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "At long last, the Iowa Democratic Party is reporting its 2020 caucus results.\n",
            "By late Wednesday evening — and after an initial delay of nearly a day after the caucuses took place — the state party had posted nearly all of the results.\n",
            "The delay in the count has been highly unusual and was driven by a combination of technical difficulties and human error. A poorly performing app for reporting results, a poorly staffed backup phone line for reporting results, and complicated new rules all seem to have played a role in the delay.\n",
            "So far, the Iowa Democratic Party has not given a timetable for when it will release the results from the remaining precincts.\n",
            "There are three separate metrics to watch in these results.\n",
            "The traditional way Iowa Democrats have determined who wins the Iowa caucuses is by state delegate equivalents. This is essentially taking the final results of the 1,600-plus precinct caucuses — which conclude in allotting county convention delegates to candidates — and weighting them to estimate how many state delegates that would correspond to. We’re displaying that number here as it comes in, and if you’re interested in understanding the math behind this in further detail, I have a longer explainer at this link.\n",
            "So in this current count of state delegate equivalents, Pete Buttigieg has a narrow lead, with Bernie Sanders close behind. Elizabeth Warren is a bit further back for third place, followed by Joe Biden in fourth and Amy Klobuchar in fifth. (Remember, there are still a number of precincts remaining to be counted and these results could certainly change.)\n",
            "Now also, this year for the first time, Iowa Democrats are releasing actual vote totals from the caucuses. First, they will release the initial vote totals each candidate got at each precinct — added up for a statewide total. This is the pre-realignment vote total, or Round 1.\n",
            "So it turns out that Sanders is in first place with a plurality of first-round votes. Buttigieg and Warren are in second and third, with Biden and Klobuchar in fourth and fifth. (And once again, these are not final vote totals and there are many remaining votes to be counted.)\n",
            "After that, at each caucus gathering, supporters of candidates who are viable — above a particular threshold (15 percent in most precincts) — are locked in. However, supporters of nonviable candidates then have the opportunity to realign and change their votes. After this, we get the final vote total, displayed below.\n",
            "As you can see, things changed a bit from the first tally. Sanders is still in first place, but Buttigieg has gotten a lot closer — he gained about 4 percentage points after the realignment, while Sanders gained a little more than 1 percentage point. Warren gained slightly more than 2 percentage points, but Biden and Klobuchar both lost support. (And, for the final time, these results are only partial and they will change as more precincts come in.)\n",
            "So far, it’s too early to call a winner for any of these metrics. What we are seeing is really that the caucuses were quite close. So far, there are only a few thousand results separating the top three candidates. Still, the results so far are obviously most encouraging for Sanders and Buttigieg (the latter of whom already declared victory before any results were in), while they’re mediocre for Warren and certainly disappointing for Biden. But all of this is, of course, subject to change as more results come in.\n",

            "So instead of responding to the end of the Russia investigation by cooling his jets, Trump was on the phone with the Ukrainian president the very next day trying to solicit political favors — the very same conduct that fueled suspicions about his Russia dealings in the first place. With Republican senators now having voted to let him off the hook for that conduct, there’s no reason to think he won’t try and do it again.\n",
            "Trump is who he is. Republican senators who justified impeaching him partly because they thought he’d be chastened by the experience were either fooling themselves or the American people. Trump’s initial response to being impeached made that perfectly clear.\n",

            "Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, just became the sole exception to the Senate’s party-line vote to acquit President Trump — and the first senator who has ever voted to remove a president of his own party.\n",
            "Romney says he broke party lines to vote to convict on one of two charges, abuse of power, because he believes Trump’s conduct shows that the president is unfit and that he “should be removed from office.”\n",

Both Johnson and Clinton were Democratic presidents, and no Democrat voted to convict either man (though some Republicans did vote to acquit).\n",
            "Johnson was impeached on three charges and nearly convicted — 35 of the 36 senators necessary to remove him from office voted to do so. At the time, the Democratic Party was a rump party, virtually powerless in Congress because they were closely associated with the Southern white secessionists who waged war against the Union.\n",

They adhered fairly reasonably to the letter of the law and can credibly claim they did all that was legally required of them. But this was a sham trial, one whose outcome was never seriously in doubt. By following the formal rules, Senate Republicans gave this fiction a veneer of formal legitimacy. All of them, with the brave exception of Mitt Romney, weaponized the letter of the law against its spirit.\n",

That these regimes contain the most direct parallels to what’s just happened in America makes clear the precise way in which our democracy is under attack.

            "“Hungary is not a democracy anymore,” Zsuzsanna Szelényi, a former Hungarian member from Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s party, told me during a 2018 visit to Budapest. “The parliament is a decoration for a one-party state.”\n",
            "Orbán and much of his inner circle are not strongmen on the classical model, but devilishly clever lawyers. After winning the country’s 2010 elections in a landslide, they ended up writing new laws and reinterpreting old ones in a way that rendered future elections largely noncompetitive.\n",
            "The government controls the airwaves and media companies to such a degree that the opposition can’t get a fair hearing. A patchwork of nonsensical regulations makes it nearly impossible for pro-democracy organizations to serve as a check on the government. Tax law and economic regulations are fundamentally political, enforcement cherry-picked in a way that punishes government critics and enriches its cronies.\n",
            "All of this happens despite a Hungarian constitution that still protects “the free establishment and operation of political parties” and “the freedom and diversity of the press.” The legal trappings of a democracy, including regular elections, a liberal-sounding constitution, and nominally independent courts, mask the actual authoritarianism of the system. It’s how sympathetic Western intellectuals like Christopher Caldwell can visit Budapest and still write that “[Orbán’s] power had been won in free elections” with a straight face.\n",
            "The brilliance of this system comes in the way it manufactures its own false legitimacy. The Hungarian government can tell both its citizens and the international community that it is still a democracy. It holds elections that aren’t obviously rigged, in the sense of having falsified ballot counts, to vindicate its claim that the people still rule. In a world where democracy is (for now) the dominant political ideology, that’s valuable for both maintaining support at home and avoiding problems internationally.\n",
            "The United States is, of course, not Hungary. But the Republicans have treated the impeachment trial as a rough equivalent of a Hungarian election: a parody of its actual thing, a performance that undermines the aim of holding the executive branch accountable while claiming to follow constitutional obligations to do just that.\n",
            "Any meaningfully fair trial would contain at least two elements the Senate impeachment proceedings lacked: full consideration of the evidence and open-minded jurors. These two defects were linked. The reason Republicans wouldn’t hear John Bolton’s testimony, despite a book manuscript suggesting he has new and damning evidence against Trump’s defense, is that they had already decided to acquit Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was quite open about all this before the trial started.\n",
            "“I’m not an impartial juror. This is a political process. There’s not anything judicial about it,” he said in December.\n",
            "McConnell put together a “trial” that would guarantee this outcome without flagrantly violating the rules of the Constitution, a kind of narrow legalism that empties out the law of its true meaning.\n",
            "When we think about the impeachment vote’s broader significance for the health of American democracy, it’s worth keeping the Hungarian model of authoritarianism in mind — and what it tells us about our democratic system’s resilience more broadly.\n",
            "Liberalism — in the broad philosophical sense of the term, not the partisan American one — loves the law. It aims to use legally sanctioned contests to tame the dangers of deep political disagreement. The poll station and the court hearing replace the battlefield and the street riot as a way of setting the balance of political power.\n",
            "For a liberal democracy like the United States to work as intended, there needs to be a set of legal procedures that govern how these contests work. Campaign regulations make elections fair, legal codes keep judges from becoming dictators in robes, and legislative rules ensure laws are enacted fairly and openly.\n",
            "Hungary’s example exposes a flaw in this dependence on such “neutral” procedures: that they don’t just enforce themselves. People interpret the law, sometimes with an eye toward fairness and sometimes without one, but always through the lens of their own values and worldview. When in power, they tend to come up with legalistic ways of justifying the policy or outcome they’d prefer.\n",
            "This is one of the central theses of a school of legal thought that rose to prominence in the 1980s, called “critical legal studies.” CLS scholars argued that the law is “indeterminate,” that legal texts mean nothing on their own and, instead, are interpreted by judges through the lens of their own particular priorities.\n",
            "“It turns out that the limits of craft are so broad that in any interesting case any reasonably skilled lawyer can reach whatever result he or she wants,” Mark Tushnet, a Georgetown University law professor and one of the key thinkers in this school of thought, wrote in 1983.\n",
            "A classic example of this indeterminacy in action came just last month, when the Trump administration argued that the 2002 law authorizing Bush’s invasion of Iraq provided legal justification for their assassination of an Iranian general (Qassem Soleimani). This was obviously not the intent of the 18-year-old law, but enough of an argument can be put together for it to serve as a fig leaf for the president’s preferred policy.\n",
            "CLS scholars argue that the indeterminacy of the law often leads to it being used to entrench structures of domination. Court rulings aren’t neutral expressions of legal reasoning but political processes determined by the interactions of involved parties (like judges, attorneys, and interest groups filing amicus briefs). Given underlying asymmetries in social and political power, the law can be used to secure the interests of those in power — even laws that are written with egalitarian intent.\n",
            "There are problems with the CLS thesis as a comprehensive theory of law. But its essential insight, that people in power can interpret the law creatively to entrench their power, has been darkly vindicated in places like Hungary. It also helps us understand the specific kind of danger the impeachment farce is warning us about.\n",
            "Republicans will not vote to give Trump dictatorial powers; we will not wake up tomorrow, the day after, or the year after in a police state. The risk, instead, is that the legal procedures necessary for a liberal democracy to work — the fairness of elections, the separation of powers, the protections of minority rights — become hollowed out from the inside, rendered meaningless despite remaining on the books.\n",
            "We will never stop claiming to be a democracy, but we might end up quietly losing so many different components of one that we ultimately lose the capacity for meaningful self-rule. The American ship of state becomes a version of the ship of Theseus, replaced plank by plank until very few of the original components remain.\n",
            "Many of these democratic planks, like voting rights and equal participation in elections, have been chipped away at for years. This fake impeachment trial shows that another one has been quietly replaced.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/6/21125026/big-tech-congress-antitrust-investigation-amazon-apple-google-facebook\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "When Elizabeth Warren took the stage for a presidential campaign rally in Brooklyn in January, thousands of supporters welcomed her by chanting, “Break them up.”\n",
            "Among the main targets of that taunt was Big Tech, the group of companies led by Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook that’s at the center of Warren’s proposed plan to level the playing field in the US economy by unwinding some of the power these giants have amassed. “They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,” Warren alleged last year.\n",
            "Still, there’s no guarantee that Warren, or another progressive like Bernie Sanders, will win the Democratic primary, let alone beat President Trump in the general election. And those outcomes are still a way off.\n",
            "But a group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives, led by Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), is pushing the conversation forward now. Cicilline and the dozen other members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee began investigating the four tech giants last spring, probing for answers through five public hearings and hundreds of written queries on how these titans have accumulated so much wealth and power, and whether they’ve done so through anti-competitive or other unlawful means.\n",
            "The long-term impact of all this remains unclear, whether it ends with the breakup of these companies, major changes in how they operate, or absolutely nothing at all. In the meantime, though, Congress’s investigation of Big Tech is having one immediate consequence: It’s applying pressure to the country’s top two antitrust enforcement agencies — the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) — which have been slow to act until now but which each announced probes of the country’s powerful tech behemoths last summer following Congress’s own announcement.\n",
            "“The House hearings created an atmosphere and were one important part of making it impossible for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice not to bring cases, including against Amazon,” William Kovacic, a former chairman of the FTC and a law professor at George Washington University, told Recode in an interview.\n",
            "Spokespeople for Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Cicilline, and the FTC declined to comment on the impact of the House investigation on the DOJ and FTC probes. Reps for Google and the DOJ did not immediately provide comment.\n",
            "The Federal Trade Commission is working on antitrust probes of Facebook and Amazon. The Department of Justice is believed to be investigating Google and Facebook, and perhaps Apple as well. Some are official investigations. Some are at earlier stages — essentially unofficial fact-finding probes. The FTC can sue companies to stop anti-competitive behavior, as well as take them to court or agree to a settlement that may include a financial penalty. It can also block mergers or acquisitions or even unwind acquisitions or mergers that have already been consummated. The Department of Justice’s antitrust division, on the other hand, is the only one of the two federal antitrust enforcers that can prosecute antitrust violations in criminal court.\n",
            "Lawmakers and regulators have different antitrust concerns about different companies: They’re concerned about if and how Amazon prioritizes its products and services over those of its partners and competitors; what Facebook’s strategy is when it acquires young, upcoming competitors; how dominant Google is in online advertising; and whether Apple’s control of the App Store leads to it unfairly favoring its own products. The tech companies have defended their business practices.\n",
            "Many of these topics and concerns were on display at the committee’s last antitrust hearing, held last month. Four executives from smaller companies, including the CEO of the popular wireless speaker company Sonos, testified about Big Tech’s upper hand and how the business practices of the tech giants have allegedly harmed their businesses.\n",
            "One of the committee’s lawmakers highlighted another upper hand: the enormous sums that these giant corporations spend on lobbying. Facebook and Amazon spent $17 million and $16 million respectively on lobbying last year, which were both record sums for the companies, according to the Washington Post. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) acknowledged “the reality that they walk into our offices and they tell us their side of the story” and the importance of smaller firms taking a risk by speaking out.\n",
            "“We are trying our best to make sure that we continue to create the environment for your kinds of companies,” he added.\n",
            "Two months earlier, Cicilline and the rest of his bipartisan committee grilled a different breed of official as part of their antitrust probe: Joseph Simons, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice.\n",
            "Neither seemed especially thrilled to be there. That might have had something to do with the topic they were discussing: Antitrust regulators’ history of enforcement — or underenforcement — of the biggest companies in tech. (The last major antitrust battle between the US government and a tech giant ended in early 2013 when the FTC cleared Google of violating antitrust law in relation to how it ranks and displays search results from competing websites like Yelp and TripAdvisor.)\n",
            "Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee under which the antitrust subcommittee sits, expressed early in the hearing how “deeply concerned” he was by the antitrust agencies’ “lax merger enforcement.” He also noted that it “has been decades since the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission has brought a significant monopolization case in the tech sector,” likely referring to the 2001 antitrust case that the DOJ brought against Microsoft.\n",
            "Later, Cicilline chastised Simons for “trading away the right” to interview Facebook leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in exchange for a $5 billion fine that some lawmakers in attendance deemed “disappointing.” The settlement resulted from the FTC’s claim that Facebook’s actions in the Cambridge Analytica scandal violated a 2012 FTC order related to an earlier suit over alleged consumer data-privacy violations. It was a record-breaking penalty for the FTC, but was criticized by some as a slap on the wrist that would not materially affect how Facebook does business. That’s in part because $5 billion is pennies when compared to the company’s profits in a given year; in 2018, they hit $22.1 billion.\n",
            "“I am very disappointed,” Simons replied to the panel of lawmakers, “that you all are disappointed.”\n",
            "Yes, the hearings have provided Congress members with the requisite moments of political grandstanding, and opportunities tailor-made for earning a headline quote. Cicilline’s reprimand of a top Amazon lawyer at one hearing — “I may remind you, sir: You are under oath” — comes to mind.\n",
            "But the nuanced lines of questioning suggest a group of lawmakers and staff striving to have a real impact. The subcommittee’s staff includes Lina Khan, the young legal scholar who wrote Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox, a paper widely read in antitrust circles that argued that current antitrust doctrine is ill-suited to rein in internet giants like Amazon. For the most part, US antitrust enforcers have, over the last few decades, favored business practices that keep consumer prices low; companies like Amazon, with its low prices, are therefore hard to attack.\n",
            "Cicilline has said publicly that the committee plans to publish a report with its findings in the “first part” of 2020, but where the investigation goes from there is unclear. The committee could make recommendations to increase the power of the FTC or to create a new regulatory agency focused exclusively on competition in digital markets.\n",
            "Cicilline could introduce new antitrust legislation. News outlets including Bloomberg News and CNBC reported late last year that Cicilline is working with presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren on a new draft bill called the Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Act.\n",
            "The draft legislation reportedly includes proposals such as a ban of most mergers in which one of the companies generates more than $40 billion in revenue a year — all of the Big Four tech giants are larger than that — as well as expanding the legal scope of what constitutes “predatory pricing” — a tactic that some Amazon critics have accused the tech giant of, but which Amazon has denied.\n",
            "But with hundreds of bills already awaiting passage in the Republican-controlled Senate, it seems unlikely the bill, if introduced, would be anything more than a stake in the ground — at least until the 2020 elections are over.\n",
            "“There’s very little chance of new legislation prior to the election, but legislative fact-finding is a long game,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, in an email to Recode. Hovenkamp cited 1940s Congressional hearings that eventually led to an expansion of merger law in 1950.\n",
            "In the meantime, the committee’s most substantial impact may be an indirect one: ratcheting up the pressure, through its public hearings and written questioning, on regulators.\n",
            "Michael Kades, an antitrust lawyer who spent 20 years at the FTC, believes the investigation plays a crucial role even if it doesn’t directly impact the decisions of the FTC or DOJ.\n",
            "“[I]t will increase the transparency and subject the decision to more scrutiny,” he said in an email to Recode. The public will be able to compare the FTC and DOJ decisions to the subcommittee’s final report, and the subcommittee will have deep knowledge to evaluate the regulator decisions as well, he added.\n",
            "The Federal Trade Commission has indeed been probing Amazon’s business practices, though neither the agency nor Amazon has confirmed a formal investigation. That might be because, as a source familiar with the probe described it in mid-January, the FTC staff is still in something of an education phase, getting up to speed on how the different business lines of Amazon work and interact.\n",
            "“I do think it’s a good-faith effort,” the person said, “but it’s in an initial stage.”\n",
            "In June, Recode reported that the agency was questioning some Amazon competitors on areas including the pricing of its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics service as well as how it bundles myriad services under the Prime membership program, potentially unfairly undercutting competitors.\n",
            "Later in 2019, Bloomberg News reported that FTC staff members were interviewing merchants who sell products on Amazon. One data point they sought was the percentage of total online sales for which the merchants rely on Amazon.\n",
            "How quickly, and in what direction, the inquiry escalates is still any outsider’s guess. But some of those who have been on the inside think the broad direction in which this story is headed is clear. “One unmistakable objective of [the House investigation] is to press the agencies to bring cases,” Kovacic, the former FTC chairman, told Recode. “It’s infeasible for the FTC to come through this calendar year without something in hand.”\n",
            "And perhaps only then would talk of breaking up Big Tech seem real.\n",
            "Title:  Acronym, the dark money group behind the Iowa caucuses app meltdown, explained \n",
            "url:  https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/5/21123009/acronym-tara-mcgowan-shadow-app-iowa-caucus-results\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "This isn’t how Acronym wanted to rocket onto the national stage.\n",
            "The Iowa caucuses debacle drew a lot of attention to a new app made by a company called Shadow that was at the center of many technical failures of the evening. And it’s also putting scrutiny on Acronym — the Democratic group that backed Shadow — which has sought the spotlight in recent months, though probably didn’t hope for this situation.\n",
            "Acronym is a relatively new Democratic group that launched in 2017 and got active around the 2018 midterms in digital organizing. Its structure is, in a word, complex. Acronym is a nonprofit, but it also has a political action committee — under its nonprofit are for-profit entities that its nonprofit sometimes pays into. It is brazen and ambitious, which is not unique for a political strategy group, but it’s also somewhat shadowy and secretive. And it’s been trying to distance itself from the Iowa debacle, even though it’s really at the center of the storm.\n",
            "If you pay attention to political media, you’ve probably noticed stories about Acronym popping up here and there in recent months.\n",
            "In November, the New York Times covered its plan to launch a $75 million digital advertising campaign to counter President Donald Trump in 2020, and the Wall Street Journal profiled a former Facebook employee who was embedded in the Trump campaign in 2016 and has since joined Acronym’s ranks. Bloomberg wrote about the Courier Newsroom, a for-profit media company under Acronym’s umbrella that runs multiple local sites that deliver left-slanted news, countering a tactic often employed by the right. Acronym’s CEO, Tara McGowan, has quickly become a high-profile figure in Democratic politics and digital strategy.\n",
            "Acronym talks a big game when it comes to its political strategy prowess — though it’s new enough and opaque enough that it’s not entirely clear what the organization is actually delivering. Now that Shadow, one of the companies affiliated with Acronym, is under the microscope, Acronym is too.\n",
            "In the wake of the Iowa caucus debacle, Acronym has tried to distance itself from Shadow. In a statement, spokesperson Kyle Tharp said that Acronym just happens to be an investor in the firm, along with others. “Acronym is a nonprofit organization and not a technology company,” Tharp said.\n",
            "Except it’s more complicated than that. Shadow is a tech company, and both Acronym and Shadow have described their relationship as an acquisition, not an investment, in the past and on multiple occasions. Acronym and McGowan in the past have touted their work with Shadow — McGowan has often touted it on Twitter and talked about it on a podcast as recently as last month. But now, Acronym has scrubbed its website of mentions of launching Shadow and says it’s just one of multiple investors along for the ride. Acronym’s decision to distance itself from Shadow — or perhaps lying about it altogether — is making the situation worse, not better.\n",
            "“I don’t think they’re evil, but in their thirst to take over the world using a bunch of short-term donor money, they leveraged their political connections to get contracts that they didn’t have the expertise to fulfill,” one Democratic strategist told me.\n",
            "But there’s a lot more to Acronym than Shadow. Under its nonprofit umbrella are multiple for-profit operations beyond Shadow, including the digital media operation Courier Newsroom and Lockwood Strategy, a digital strategy firm that McGowan runs. Acronym also operates a political action committee called Pacronym and publishes a podcast hosted by McGowan as well as a weekly newsletter.\n",
            "“There’s this whole group of organizations that are feeding each other, and they’re ultimately all controlled by the same group of people,” another strategist said.\n",
            "Acronym has for months been building itself up as one of the loudest players in the room in Democratic strategy. Now, people are starting to look under the hood.\n",
            "Acronym did not return requests for comment for this story. On Wednesday evening, McGowan published a lengthy post on Medium as well as a series of tweets attempting to clarify the situation. She sought to cast Acronym as an investor in many of its projects, though she did acknowledge some “warts” in Shadow’s operations and wrote that “progress requires taking calculated risks and doing things differently.” McGowan also appeared to distance herself and Acronym from Shadow. She did not acknowledge Acronym’s attempts to downplay its relationship with Shadow, including altering its website.\n",
            "McGowan, 34, has deep ties to the Democratic Party and has worked in Democratic circles for years. She started her career as a journalist and according to her LinkedIn profile got into politics when she worked as press secretary for Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island in 2010.  Then in 2011, she went over to the Obama White House where she worked as a digital producer, after which she had stints at Tom Steyer’s NextGen America and consultancy Purpose. She later headed digital strategy at Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action. In early 2017, McGowan founded Lockwood Strategy, a digital strategy firm she still runs. A month later, she launched Acronym.\n",
            "On its website, Acronym describes itself as a “values-driven organization focused on advancing progressive causes through innovative communications, advertising, and organizing programs.” The organization claims that its affiliated PAC helped get 65 progressive candidates elected in 2018 with “new tech and digital-first strategies to register and turn out voters.”\n",
            "A handful of traits have marked Acronym’s development in recent years: its intertwining with Facebook, its ability to get good press, and, in turn, its growing popularity with donors.\n",
            "In September 2019, Ozy profiled McGowan as the Democrats’ “most dangerous digital strategist.” In November 2019, the New York Times ran a splashy story about Acronym’s plan to raise $75 million to push back against President Donald Trump on Facebook. The organization had raised only about 40 percent of that amount at the time.\n",
            "Trump’s reelection campaign manager, Brad Parscale, has cultivated a public reputation for himself as a political digital guru — which, depending on who you ask, is or is not an accurate portrayal — and Acronym plans to answer that. And it has some big names in tow, the most prominent being former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, who told the Times that the idea behind the effort was to have a Facebook ads mechanism in place before the Democratic Party’s nominee has been picked.\n",
            "“Our nominee is going to be broke, tired, have to pull together the party and turn around on a dime and run a race for a completely different audience,” he said.\n",
            "Weeks later, the Wall Street Journal published a profile of James Barnes, a former Facebook employee who had been embedded with the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential race. The 2,500-word story cast Barnes as a figure who had seen the light and come over to the Democrats’ side with Acronym to try to undo what he’d done in the last election. Barnes isn’t the only former Facebooker in Acronym’s ranks; earlier in the day on Monday, hours ahead of the caucuses, a former Facebook data scientist announced he was joining the organization.\n",
            "McGowan herself has become an increasingly common fixture in media stories, often commenting on the issues of the day. (Acronym has spoken with and sent statements to Vox about digital political strategy in the past.) When Google announced it would limit microtargeting around political ads, igniting speculation Facebook might follow suit, McGowan slammed the decision and said it wouldn’t curb disinformation but would instead “hinder campaigns and others who are already working against the tide of bad actors to reach voters with facts.” She said the decision affects Google’s ad inventory as well as inventory across the internet. “They are essentially using their market power to limit how campaigns can speak to voters where they get their information,” she said.\n",
            "But there are indicators that things within Acronym are not as seamless as they would appear from the outside. One Acronym staffer told the Outline it is “far and away the most disorganized place I’ve ever been a part of.” According to the staffer, leadership says it’s just the “startup environment” of a new company, but it’s unclear how many people work at Acronym, or who they work for. There are a lot of blurred lines between the various Acronym outfits — for example, job links on the Courier News website redirect to Lockwood Strategy.\n",
            "Acronym is a dark money group. That means donations to its 501(c)(4) nonprofit don’t have to be reported, and we don’t entirely know who their money is coming from — or how much they have.\n",
            "But Federal Election Commission filings show Acronym’s PAC, Pacronym, is doing pretty well. Billionaire hedge funder Seth Klarman gave $1.5 million to the PAC in the fourth quarter of last year, venture capitalist Michael Moritz $1 million, and director Steven Spielberg $500,000, among others. As Recode’s Teddy Schleifer pointed out this week, the donation was Moritz’s first since 2011, and his largest disclosed political contribution ever.\n",
            "To raise that much money and obtain such a high profile, an organization like Acronym has to talk a big game. That’s what some of the four Democratic strategists I spoke with — all on the condition of anonymity so they could speak freely on the matter — see as part of the problem. Acronym knows how to get eager donors, especially those who are eager to get in on the next big thing, to buy into what it’s selling.\n",
            "“Their pitch is that everyone is doing it wrong, and they’re here to disrupt and innovate,” one Democratic strategist told me. “And they don’t always follow through with that in a successful way.”\n",
            "“On paper it sounds great,” another strategist said. “Investors want to invest in shiny, new, cutting-edge things, but there’s not a ton of actual evidence there.”\n",
            "Part of the issue is that Acronym’s structure is complex, unusual, and opaque. Its major plank may be a nonprofit, but the entities under it are not. McGowan runs Lockwood Strategy and is, presumably, paying herself a salary out of the companies coffers, which is not illegal. Shadow and the Courier Newsroom are also private companies. So sometimes, when Acronym makes public pronouncements about what it’s going to do and spend on, it’s not clear where the money is coming from — or where it’s ending up. For example, in October, Acronym said it would spend $1 million on digital impeachment ads in swing states. And its FEC filings show that many independent expenditures for digital ad buys against Trump were filtered through Lockwood Strategies, which McGowan runs. That’s all really hard to track.\n",
            "“With public pronouncements about things they’re doing that don’t happen, there’s less transparency about why,” one strategist said.\n",
            "Some observers have also raised questions about the Courier Newsroom, which runs hypertargeted local news with a lean to the left. Last year, McGowan told Bloomberg that Courier Newsroom planned to focus on six swing states — Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin — and “fill the news deserts, deliver the facts favorable to Democrats that [McGowan thinks] voters are missing, and counter right-wing spin.”\n",
            "While politically biased news is hardly a new phenomenon in American politics — look at Fox News and the myriad of right-leaning outlets, for example — the Courier Newsroom launch did raise some eyebrows. If this were a Republican operative declaring its strategy like this, a lot of Democrats probably would have criticized it. So the reaction from the left has been a bit awkward.\n",
            "Lachlan Markay at the Daily Beast drilled down on what’s so odd about Acronym’s approach:\n",
            "But in trying to take on such a wide swath of digital political roles, ACRONYM has also been drawn into roles that appear to be in conflict: not just political vendor and vote tabulator, but also ostensibly-independent media mogul and Democratic activist.\n",
            "Such conflicts have been apparent in ACRONYM’s backing of a handful of state-specific media organs billed as editorially-independent journalistic outfits. Through investment in an entity called Courier Newsroom, McGowan’s group has seeded such outlets in the key swing states of Wisconsin, Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. The left-leaning consulting firm Lockwood Strategy, in turn, has helped staff up the outlets, and in at least one case, Lockwood was on the payroll of the Virginia Democratic Party as an ACRONYM-backed outlet favorably covered the party’s 2019 statehouse candidates.\n",
            "In other words, one McGowan company was drawing a paycheck from the party as another pumped out news content boosting its election prospects.\n",
            "Acronym’s founders made a bet that donors are often willing to throw money at vague digital projects, especially amid anxieties about the 2020 elections and concerns Democrats are lagging behind in terms of online and data strategy. And so they’ve built out a complex organization that lets them raise money and spend money — including on themselves — with their actual impact remaining unclear. At least until Iowa.\n",
            "Sometimes, despite the best of intentions, technologies fail. And when they do, many would argue that the best path forward is for whoever built the tech to own up to the problem and quickly try to fix it. But that has not happened in Iowa.\n",
            "This is not to say that Acronym is to blame for the meltdown in the Iowa caucuses. However, it’s become increasingly clear that the organization hurried to distance itself from the situation.\n",
            "After it came out that the Shadow-built app, which according to Vice was called the IowaReporterApp, was at the center of the Iowa caucuses delays, Acronym came out with a statement saying it was just an investor in the tech company. It read, in part:\n",
            "Acronym is a nonprofit organization and not a technology company. As such, we have not provided any technology to the Iowa Democratic Party, Presidential campaigns, or the Democratic National Committee.\n",
            "Acronym is an investor in several for-profit companies across the progressive media and technology sectors. One of those independent, for-profit companies is Shadow, Inc, which also has other private investors.\n",
            "But the tenuous relationship described in the statement above doesn’t appear to be accurate. Or at the very least, both Acronym and Shadow have described their relationship differently in the past.\n",
            "Shadow was initially a tech firm named Groundbase, founded by Hillary Clinton campaign veterans Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis and funded by progressive nonprofit Higher Ground Labs. The company was struggling after its campaign texting platform failed to take off, and Acronym stepped in to inject some cash and keep it from going bankrupt. They launched Shadow from there and new products, including an email app that was supposed to help the Democratic Party centralize its data. In a 2019 article, Shadow described its flagship product as a “universal adapter for political data and technology.” In practice, what that means is pretty indecipherable.\n",
            "Acronym distancing itself from Shadow is a new development. In 2019, McGowan celebrated acquiring Groundbase and marketed the company openly on Twitter. Acronym put it on its website as well. While Acronym has since clarified it doesn’t own Shadow entirely, the organization has previously said it is “launching” Shadow and described the deal as an acquisition. On LinkedIn, Niemira lists himself as a former Acronym employee.\n",
            "The problem is, Acronym left a lot of evidence that suggests it used to have a much closer relationship with Shadow than it’s now admitting to. According to the Intercept, for instance, Acronym and Shadow share an office space in Denver, Colorado, and as recently as last month, McGowan said Acronym was the “sole investor” in Shadow.\n",
            "If you look at Acronym's \"About\" page today it says \"we invested in Shadow\" but if you look at the Wayback Machine from last month it's \"we launched Shadow\" pic.twitter.com/FM5XVddclh\n",
            "The, well, shadow around Shadow has been part of what’s so weird about the Iowa debacle. Prior to Monday, Shadow’s involvement in the Iowa caucuses had been kept secret. The Iowa Democrats said they were using a new app, but they wouldn’t name it, arguing that it was a security precaution to keep it from being hacked. Had they not been secretive about it, maybe someone would have noticed the problems with it prior to caucus day. Multiple sources told the Times that the app was under-tested and that caucus volunteers were poorly trained on how to use it.\n",
            "Curiously, David Plouffe was asked about Acronym and Shadow on MSNBC on Monday as the Iowa caucuses debacle unfolded. Plouffe, seemingly unfamiliar with the app, said he didn’t know about it and had spoken via text with the CEO — presumably McGowan — who confirmed that Acronym was an investor in the tech. “I have no knowledge of Shadow or what’s happening,” he said. It’s entirely possible that Plouffe hadn’t heard of Shadow, as a board member whose main role seems to be to boost the group’s profile and fundraising. The Acronym team seems to have decided to stick with that distancing of ties to the app.\n",
            "Regardless of the level of Acronym’s involvement, it still remains unclear how Shadow managed to release such a problematic app for such an event as important as the Iowa caucuses. One strategist I spoke with speculated this may have simply been a case of an overly ambitious agreement between Shadow and the Iowa Democratic Party, which reportedly paid just $60,000 for the app. Perhaps there was just too much excitement over the new, shiny thing.\n",
            "“This has all the markings of a pet project of someone who says, ‘Oh, we can do that,’” the strategist said. “You let a company that has no track record just build the most important thing you’ve probably done in the last decade, and yeah, it was going to fail.”\n",
            "At best, Acronym’s behavior around Shadow could be described as odd. That and the Iowa Democratic Party’s initial secrecy around its relationship with Shadow has led to a number of conspiracy theories around the app malfunction and results delay. Some Bernie Sanders supporters have suggested this is an effort to undermine the Vermont senator, who prior to the caucuses was leading the polls, and boost a more establishment-friendly candidate, namely, Pete Buttigieg. Some on Trump’s side have claimed this amounts to rigging the election as well. And after the Des Moines Register’s Iowa poll was pulled from being released over the weekend, suspicions and conspiracies had already been afoot.\n",
            "Shadow is raising even more suspicion now that its work with Democratic candidates has also been revealed. Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and plenty of others have paid Shadow for services, and in the past, McGowan has expressed her support for Buttigieg. (McGowan’s husband is also a senior strategist for Buttigieg.) Some Acronym employees have previously worked for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and are well-connected among Democratic insiders.\n",
            "Many on the left — especially Sanders supporters who believe the cards were stacked in favor of Clinton in the 2016 election — are highly skeptical of the legitimacy of the Democratic primary.\n",
            "During the last election, the Democratic National Committee held few debates and at awkward times, which some alleged was an effort to keep Sanders from getting airtime, and undertook other efforts that appeared to favor Clinton. Superdelegates pledged to her early in the process, seemingly anointing her the nominee. Sanders’s backers believe the Democratic establishment doesn’t want him to win the nomination this time, either (and indeed, some don’t) and worry about what lengths they might go to in order to stop him. Iowa’s big app fail doesn’t appease those concerns, and Acronym’s lack of transparency around its ties doesn’t help.\n",
            "That there is some bad blood regarding Acronym among Democratic politicos — which is natural in any competitive industry — has become clear in the wake of the Shadow debacle. One strategist told me that the scrutiny on the organization was natural — it’s very young, very hyped, and seems primed for a misstep. Another was more cutting in their assessment of the situation: “People have been waiting for this to blow up and did not foresee that this would blow up in quite a spectacular way.”\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "July 2017 seems like a million years ago now, but in some ways it feels like little has changed. Take this article I wrote that month. The headline is “The latest revelation won’t end Trump’s presidency. Only Paul Ryan can.” The first section is subtitled “Robert Mueller can’t fell Donald Trump.”\n",
            "The only part of that which feels dated — and the main mistake I see in my analysis, in retrospect — is the name “Paul Ryan.” It was never up to Paul Ryan, after all. His successor, Nancy Pelosi, did impeach Trump for holding aid to Ukraine hostage in hopes of damaging a political rival.\n",
            "But what has become clear in the two and a half years since is that the House’s role was only preamble. Yes, Trump will go down in history books as the third president to be impeached. But he will not go down in history as the first president to be removed. The Senate’s vote to acquit him on charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power guarantees that.\n",
            "This is a deeply unsatisfying punchline to the past few years of American politics. At least since Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign in June 2015, journalists and activists have been asking: Is this the scandal that finally does him in?\n",
            "Would his casual description of Mexican immigrants as rapists in his announcement speech force him to drop out shortly after he jumped in? Would his attack on John McCain for being captured in Vietnam end his campaign? Or proposing an all-out ban on Muslim immigration?\n",
            "What about the revelation of a tape on which he brags about sexually assaulting women? Or the stories from multiple women who said he did sexually assault them? Or leaking highly classified information to the Russian government? Or intimidating Ukraine into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden? Would any of these be enough to finally bring Trump down?\n",
            "As it turns out, the answer in each case was no. That’s not because none of these things should have been enough to end his campaign or force him out of office. Each of them should have been enough!\n",
            "But the sad truth is that whether or not Trump was “brought down” had at best an indirect relationship to the truth and the gravity of the charges against him. The hope that he would be gone rested entirely on a hope that at least 20 Republican senators would do the right thing. And anybody who has paid attention to Mitch McConnell’s Republican Party the past decade would have told you that was never going to happen. In the end, only one Republican senator, Mitt Romney, did the right thing.\n",
            "In 2018, the New Yorker’s Adam Davidson called the FBI’s raid on former Trump attorney Michael Cohen “the end stage of the Trump presidency” — a prediction that obviously will not come to pass. But what’s more interesting than the prediction was the emotion behind it, a yearning for something, anything, to end the death loop that American democracy appears to be trapped in. In the liberal imagination, that blow-up took the form of Trump’s removal from office, an event that sets us back toward a path of normalcy and sane politics.\n",
            "This yearning is understandable, but it is misplaced. For one thing, ending the Trump presidency will not fix, or even substantially ameliorate, most of the problems plaguing the American political system. They were mounting for years before he took office — indeed, they made him possible — and will continue to plague us for years after he leaves.\n",
            "And more importantly, as this week clarifies, there will be no dramatic end for Trump. There never was going to be one. If he leaves office, it’s not going to be because the other shoe drops. There’s no revelation that can do that when [gesticulates wildly to everything that has happened and been revealed since 2015] was not enough.\n",
            "If he leaves office, it will be because he loses the 2020 election. That was always the case. We were always going to have to do this the hard way.\n",
            "Most observers acknowledge that American democracy is in a pretty bad way.\n",
            "Until 2015, the problems our democracy confronted were mounting but largely faceless. Trump gave them a human form.\n",
            "He illustrates the US’s susceptibility to demagoguery and to the influence of billionaires seeking to deregulate their own businesses and cut their own taxes. He won with the assistance of one of America’s most broken and anti-majoritarian institutions (the Electoral College) with a congressional majority bolstered by gerrymandering and the underrepresentation of left-leaning urban areas.\n",
            "He shows how America’s thermostatic electorate, constantly responding to one party’s electoral success with a dramatic swing to the other side, can undermine democratic responsiveness by catapulting a party with a deeply unpopular agenda into office. And he shows how dangerous the presidency’s extraordinary war powers can be in the wrong hands.\n",
            "So it’s no wonder his presidency has proved a breeding ground for fantasies of his regime’s demise that range from the responsible — see my colleague Ezra Klein’s case that Trump should be impeached for being ridiculously bad at his job — to the conspiratorial and preposterous (see Louise Mensch’s claims that Trump’s impeachment and arrest were imminent and that the “Marshal of the Supreme Court” had informed the president his impeachment was coming; or Jamie Kirchick, who even before Trump’s presidency was musing about a military coup unseating him).\n",
            "As the late literary critic Frank Kermode argued in his book The Sense of an Ending, humans crave narrative structure. “We are surrounded by [chaos], and equipped for coexistence with it only by our fictive powers,” he wrote. We can’t see the world as a sequence of events, one right after another, with no end or resolution in sight. “To see everything as out of mere succession,” he observed, “is to behave like a man drugged or insane.”\n",
            "We can’t see what’s happening to American politics as just a succession of events that, in themselves, mean nothing. They have to be leading up to a climactic Götterdämmerung in which our slate is wiped clean. This is the yearning behind bold predictions of the Trump administration’s collapse — that made Mueller, then the impeachment process, such a vessel for liberal hopes.\n",
            "So where does this leave us? Everything feels horrible, Trump is still in office, and he’s not going anywhere.\n",
            "The glib answer is that if you don’t want Trump to be president, you should make sure he loses the 2020 election. He’s the favorite at this point given the strength of the economy and the advantage of incumbency, but incumbents sometimes lose and Democrats have a number of strong candidates.\n",
            "But a Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren presidency isn’t going to wipe clean the system’s problems. The maladies remain. To borrow a quote that 2020 hopeful Pete Buttigieg likely knows well, “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”\n",
            "And absent a revolutionary shock to create a radically new political order, the best we can do is just muddle along.\n",
            "That is probably the one unromantic takeaway that the Trump experience has left me with. We fantasize about an early, dramatic end to the Trump years in part because that signals a return to normalcy and a rejection of all the dysfunctions he symbolizes. But Trump was never going to be frog-marched out of the White House. And even if he was, it wouldn’t have solved our problems.\n",
            "I understand the yearning not to muddle through, for a big, climactic finish to both the Trump presidency and the American national nightmare. But if muddling through is to lead anywhere, we ought to be prepared for it, and prepared to make the most of it, rather than thinking a deus ex machina like impeachment will blow the whole thing up in a stroke.\n",
            "The Trump years will likely end with a whimper rather than a bang — just as the conclusion of Watergate did not lead to a cleansed and more ethical politics (though there was a flurry of reforms that improved things for a spell), and just as the financial crisis did not usher in a new era of ethical banking (same).\n",
            "But we don’t have to wait for the Trump presidency to end, or force it to end, to start thinking about what a more systematic approach to fixing American politics would look like. It will not make for a very good, eventful movie, and it will be a long and at times unfulfilling slog. But it’ll be the only way we can make it through.\n",

Romney was also one of just two Republicans to vote in favor of considering more witnesses for the trial last week, alongside Sen. Susan Collins. He voted in line with his party on the second article, obstruction of Congress.\n",
            "“What [the president] did was not perfect. It was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values,” Romney said on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon while explaining his decision. “Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one’s oath of office that I can imagine.”\n",
            "You can watch his full speech here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite Romney’s past critiques of Trump, the decision is a shocking one.\n",
            "Collins — and fellow moderates who did not vote to call witnesses, like Lamar Alexander — argued that Trump’s alleged decision to condition military aid to Ukraine on the announcement of investigations into the Bidens was wrong but not worthy of removal. Romney’s differing conclusion made the vote to convict Trump a bipartisan one, unlike the House vote on the articles of impeachment, when not a single Republican voted in favor of them.\n",
            "In his floor remarks Wednesday, Romney systematically dismantled the arguments presented by Trump’s defense and repeatedly cited his faith as central to making his final decision.\n",
            "“My promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside,” he said. “Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me, for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history’s rebuke.”\n",
            "Romney added, too, that he was breaking with his party due to an “inescapable conviction” on the subject, even as he was lobbied by other Republicans to maintain unity and loyalty to the president.\n",
            "Senate Republicans have broadly stuck by Trump’s side largely due to how popular he remains with the Republican base, 89 percent of whom approve of the job he’s doing as president, according to a recent Gallup poll. Romney won’t be up for reelection until 2024, meaning that he didn’t need to weigh the same electoral consequences of voting to convict as some of his colleagues may have.\n",
            "His actions, though, are consistent with his past stances. Ever since news broke about Trump’s efforts to condition military aid to Ukraine on the announcement of political investigations, Romney has been one of the most outspoken Republican critics.\n",
            "In an interview with Fox News following his Wednesday speech, Romney said that he is aware his party — and its base — may not be happy with his vote, but that he does not believe he had any other choice, placing the president’s conduct in stark terms: “I believe that the act he took, an effort to corrupt an election, is as destructive an attack on the oath of office and our Constitution as I can imagine.”\n",
            "And when asked if he believes Trump should be removed from office, Romney told Fox’s Chris Wallace, “I do believe he should be removed from office.”\n",

            "The Senate just voted to acquit President Donald Trump of charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — ending a more than four-month impeachment process that began after revelations that Trump had withheld aid from Ukraine and pressured its leader to investigate Hunter Biden.\n",
            "The acquittal is the third time in US history the Senate has acquitted a president who has previously been impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999.\n",
            "While several Republican senators acknowledged the president’s wrongdoing, nearly all of them eventually voted to acquit Trump of both articles. Sen. Mitt Romney, ultimately, was the only senator to break with his party and vote to convict on the abuse of power charge.\n",
            "As a result, the vote on the two articles was slightly different. Senators voted 52-48 to acquit the president on abuse of power, and 53-47 to acquit him of obstruction of Congress.\n",
            "The outcome was not a surprise. It would have taken 67 votes to convict the president, meaning 20 Republicans would have had to cross over and join the Democrats’ 47-member caucus. Given Republicans’ unwillingness to break with the president, that was always an unlikely outcome. After 51 Republicans voted against calling witnesses, the vote was all but a foregone conclusion.\n",
            "The vote caps off a tumultuous few months in the House and the Senate that has been filled with bitter fights over subpoenas, witness testimony and process. During the last few weeks, House impeachment managers presented an overwhelming slate of evidence to demonstrate Trump’s willingness to abuse his power in order to get reelected. By the conclusion of the trial, many Senate Republicans were no longer denying the president’s wrongdoing so much as arguing that it didn’t merit removal.\n",

And while several moderates including Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Lamar Alexander, and Rob Portman have said they think Trump’s handling of aid to Ukraine was improper, all but Romney balked at going any further.\n",
            "As the final impeachment vote clearly illustrates, the conference continues to remain fiercely united behind the president. This loyalty is driven heavily by the support that Trump continues to receive from the Republican base. According to a recent Gallup poll, 89 percent of Republicans approved of the job he was doing as president.\n",
            "Last year, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a swing-state senator up for reelection in 2020, experienced firsthand what happens when a Republican goes against Trump: After writing a Washington Post op-ed opposing the national emergency Trump had declared to obtain funds for his border wall, Tillis was threatened with a primary challenge and quickly reversed course.\n",

Lindsey Graham has suggested that there should be more investigations into Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Burisma, though the conspiracy theory about the former vice president’s work on Ukraine and corruption has already been debunked. And the House could continue its own investigations, though what that looks like is not yet clear: Schiff declined to say whether the House would subpoena former National Security Adviser John Bolton when asked this weekend.\n",

Afterward, the Republican-held Senate chose not to investigate further by declining to call any witnesses in its trial of the president.

            "One reason is that it makes America look good to get another country to run its government better and treat its people well. The other reason is that it benefits America to have more stable countries with fewer security problems to trade with.\n",
            "But many nations, particularly more autocratic ones, are loath to change their ways. The US could use its military might to force governments to do what it says, but that would be dangerous and costly, and other countries would surely turn on America. The US, then, hopes the power of its example at home can inspire corrupt governments that flout the rule of law to reform.\n",
            "The problem is the “soft power” America wields is dwindling thanks to Trump and his allies.\n",
            "One clear example of this was a situation George Kent, a top State Department official on European affairs, described in his closed-door deposition to the House last October during the impeachment inquiry. He discussed the Trump administration efforts to stop Ukraine’s government from opening an investigation into former President Petro Poroshenko. Per Kent, a top Ukrainian official looked back at the Americans and said, “What? You mean the type of investigations you’re pushing for us to do on Biden and [Hillary] Clinton?”\n",
            "In an ideal America, Trump would have received a severe reprimand for abusing his power and his corrupt practices, like using the presidency to enrich himself and his family. Even if short of impeachment, Republicans could’ve placed severe political pressure on Trump by showing him their support has limits.\n",
            "That’s not what happened. Instead, Trump’s party will be responsible for letting him get away with the Ukraine scandal basically unpunished. As moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) out it when explaining she would vote to acquit Trump, she (and surely others) claim Trump has “learned” from the impeachment experience and will alter his behavior.\n",
            "Of course, Trump has been formally impeached, and that in itself is significant. But given that no House Republicans voted for impeachment, Trump and his allies can argue (and have) that it was merely a partisan political ploy and not the serious rebuke for his behavior it is supposed to be.\n",
            "It’s worse when considering one of the arguments Trump’s legal team made: that a president can basically do whatever he wants in order to get reelected if he believes his reelection is good for the country.\n",
            "“Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,” Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz contended in front of the Senate last week. “If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”\n",
            "He went on:\n",
            "It would be a much harder case if a hypothetical president of the United States said to a hypothetical leader of a foreign country, ‘unless you build a hotel with my name on it, and unless you give me a million dollar kickback, I will withhold the funds.’ That’s an easy case. That’s purely corrupt and in the purely private interest.\n",
            "But a complex middle case is, ‘I want to be elected. I think I’m a great president. I think I’m the greatest president there ever was. If I’m not elected the national interest will suffer greatly.’ That cannot be impeachable.\n",
            "That’s a deeply troubling message to send to the rest of the world, particularly autocrats who want to remain in power for years. Now when US diplomats tell their foreign counterparts to be less corrupt, fix partisan problems, and adhere to the rule of law, there’s a greater chance those talking points won’t resonate.\n",
            "“Toxic partisanship and deepening ideological fault lines in America, without question, has a significant impact on America’s role as a promoter of democracy and beacon of human rights,” Richard Javad Heydarian, an expert on US-Asia relations at the National Chengchi University in Taiwan, told me earlier this week. “The damage is really to the glitter of America’s supposed exceptionalism.”\n",
            "And should Trump be reelected despite all this, Heydarian continued, it would send a strong message to foreign governments that a leader can disregard the law while not losing public support, especially since he’ll have fewer restrictions on his behavior during a second term.\n",
            "This is why most Democrats running for president are pushing for anti-corruption measures to be even more central to US foreign policy. Progressives say they are horrified by how Trump has cozied up to dictators and authoritarians from Saudi Arabia to Russia to North Korea. His “America First” style has also led him to ignore human rights and democracy around the world, values the US historically stood for (at least in theory), in favor of the economy and trade.\n",
            "The way to reverse Trump’s damage? Stopping corruption worldwide. The theory, as progressive foreign policy proponents tell me, is that authoritarians benefit from corrupt practices — like having access to dark money or putting sycophants in positions of power. Thus, by curbing that behavior, the US will help democracy flourish and raise its soft-power standing.\n",
            "But it’s unclear whether a new Democratic administration would be able to reverse the damage Trump’s acquittal will have on America’s prestige.\n",
            "In fact, the US actually has become a more corrupt country on Trump’s watch. According to the watchdog group Transparency International, the US was tied for the world’s 16th-least corruption nation in 2017. As of 2019, America slipped to 22nd.\n",
            "The world, without question, has taken notice — and it’s already hurting US foreign policy. “This severely undermines America’s credibility and moral ascendancy,” says Heydarian.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "This afternoon — and for the third time in history — the US Senate will vote on acquitting or convicting a president of multiple articles of impeachment. The outcome is one that’s essentially been expected since the trial started just over two weeks ago: President Donald Trump will be acquitted.\n",
            "Given Republicans’ 53-person majority in the Senate, the votes are going to fall far short of the 67 needed to convict and remove the president from office.\n",
            "Still, the vote is a striking one. It follows an acrimonious Senate trial — the shortest in history — during which House impeachment managers presented an overwhelming amount of evidence to make their case for the two articles of impeachment. Those two articles, first passed by the House last year, charge the president with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They managers noted that Trump both conditioned military aid to Ukraine on the announcement of investigations into his political rivals and tried to block Congress from investigating at all.\n",
            "Trump’s defense, however, effectively argued that a president has leeway to do whatever he wants if it’s in the interest of his reelection, and that any wrongdoing he committed did not warrant removal from office.\n",
            "Several Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander and Rob Portman, have acknowledged that Trump’s actions were wrong. They’ve declined, however, to vote in favor of conviction, unlike Sen. Mitt Romney — who made a surprise announcement Wednesday that he would vote to convict on one article of impeachment.\n",
            "You can watch the vote, which begins at 4 pm ET, on CSPAN or on the Vox Facebook page.\n",
            "At this point, we pretty much know how everyone will vote, save for two Senate Democrats seen as potential defectors.\n",
            "Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin have yet to reveal whether they will vote to convict or acquit — and both could peel away from their party, largely due to pressure from constituents.\n",
            "Manchin, a senator from West Virginia — which went for Trump by double digits in 2016 — previously voted with Republicans on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation and is known for defecting on contentious votes in the past. While he’s not up for reelection anytime soon, he’s repeatedly said he’s undecided about how he’ll vote.\n",
            "“I do believe a bipartisan majority of this body would vote to censure President Trump for his action in this matter,” Manchin said earlier this week. “Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines.”\n",
            "Sinema isn’t up for re-election either, though Arizona independents aren’t as supportive of impeachment, a dynamic that is likely to factor into her decision.\n",
            "Senate Democrats are hoping to keep up a united front on the vote, much like Republicans have. In the House, no Republicans voted in favor of charging Trump with articles of impeachment. In the Senate, though, Romney has already guaranteed that the vote will be a bipartisan one.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "Halfway through Miss Americana, the new Netflix documentary about Taylor Swift, Swift tells us a little about why she became a pop star.\n",
            "“We’re people who got into this line of work because we wanted people to like us,” she explains. “Because we were intrinsically insecure. Because we liked the sound of people clapping, because it made us forget how much we feel like we’re not good enough.” She gets audibly teary as she adds, “I’ve been doing this for 15 years, and I’m tired of it!”\n",
            "It’s a candid, revelatory moment, and one that speaks to how much pressure Swift has put on the fact of her fame to prove something to herself about her self-worth. The rest of Miss Americana takes pains to show us all the ways that fame, in turn, has put pressure on Swift: pressure to starve herself, to reinvent herself, but also to remain forever stuck at the same age she was when she first became famous. Fame has pressured her to stay silent about all the things she does not wish to stay silent about, lest she give anyone cause to dislike her.\n",
            "All told, Miss Americana makes a solid argument that fame is not good for Taylor Swift’s mental health, that it has hurt her. But the movie makes that argument from within the framework of the very celebrity industry that dealt that damage. It is a Netflix documentary that the entire Taylor Swift publicity apparatus participated in, because Miss Americana exists, at least in part, to sell Taylor Swift to us.\n",
            "At this January’s Grammys, Demi Lovato made her first public performance since she was hospitalized following a drug overdose in 2018. It was a much-hyped return for Lovato, and the song she premiered on the Grammys stage, “Anyone,” was explicitly about her troubled relationship with fame and celebrity. Her performance made the argument that Lovato’s fame is intimately intertwined with her addiction, her history of self-harm, and her eating disorder.\n",
            "“I feel stupid when I sing, nobody’s listening to me,” Lovato sings, and, “I used to crave the world’s attention, I think I cried too many times. I just need some more affection, anything to get me by.” According to “Anyone,” Lovato is driven to addiction in part by a deep and existential loneliness. And her career as a pop star only exacerbates that loneliness.\n",
            "As Spencer Kornhaber argued at the Atlantic in 2018, Lovato’s substance abuse issues have figured into her image for a long time now. In fact, for some of the industry, they are part of what makes her a valuable star. “All along, her resistance to being airbrushed — literally and figuratively — has been part of her appeal,” Kornhaber writes. He cites Lovato’s former manager Phil McIntyre on what made Lovato appealing to Disney Channel executives when she was launching her pop career as a teenager: “There was a natural edge to her that made her authentic,” said McIntyre in 2017. “They needed her to make their projects cooler.”\n",
            "Lovato’s Grammys performance was undeniably and genuinely moving, a moment of true emotional honestly on the Grammys stage. But it was also a moment that the apparatus of celebrity all around Lovato was working hard to package and commodify. That performance exists, at least in part, to sell Demi Lovato to us.\n",
            "It’s fashionable right now for celebrities to admit their weaknesses, to be transparent, to tell us exactly how much it takes out of them to turn themselves from ordinary human beings into the larger-than-life figures they become for us onstage and onscreen. We like it when celebrities show their work — which, in turn, makes us feel closer to them than we were before. The transparency generates intimacy.\n",
            "But what’s odd about this current moment of vulnerability from Swift and Lovato is that they are explicitly telling us that the intimacy we — their audience — feel with them is hurting them. Being famous is hurting them. It’s making Taylor Swift starve herself and obsess over whether people like her enough; it’s making Demi Lovato binge and purge and cut and use.\n",
            "Then the celebrity machine around those two stars, the infrastructure that has turned them each into multimillion-dollar industries, is taking those admissions and using them to manufacture an even more intense sense of intimacy between star and public. It is reinforcing the very relationship that both Swift and Lovato say is hurting them, and it’s reinforcing that relationship because it’s profitable.\n",
            "I don’t want to suggest that rich and famous celebrities are the powerless victims of a machine they can’t control, or that they’re not getting anything out of their fame. Both Swift and Lovato are enormously wealthy: They have money and awards and industry acclaim, and they both appear to genuinely love their fans — to love, as Swift put it, “the sound of people clapping.” But it’s also very clear that their fame has been psychologically painful to both of them — and that whenever they say as much, the system all around them turns that pain into something on which the public is invited to feast.\n",
            "Essentially, we’ve created a system in which part of the intimacy between celebrity and public is the public’s knowledge of the harm our attention is causing to these people. Our knowledge of that harm then draws them ever closer, creating yet more attention that can then be digested into cash for both the celebrity and the infrastructure surrounding them. It’s self-perpetuating and self-feeding, and right now, it feels endless.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave speeches on Tuesday night responding to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, with Whitmer providing a moderate’s vision for the Democratic Party and Sanders making the case for reviving America through left-wing policies.\n",
            "While Whitmer was the one giving the official Democratic Party response to Trump’s remarks, it was actually Sanders’s speech that seemed to be most directly in conversation with the president’s address. This was something Trump seemed to anticipate, with his remarks full of strident warnings of a socialist takeover of America.\n",
            "Those warnings — and the ways in which the speeches seemed to clash — served as a potential preview of a 2020 general campaign season in which left-wing populism emerges as the chief challenge to Trump’s right-wing populism.\n",
            "It is far from clear who the Democratic presidential nominee will be. But the fact that the addresses came just one night after the Iowa caucuses kicked off, with indications that Sanders — and the progressive politics he represents — could be a dominant force in the Democratic primary, certainly brings that potential dynamic into focus.\n",
            "And this makes Whitmer’s and Sanders’s speeches neat encapsulations of the choices Democratic voters face in the primary.\n",
            "Whitmer, who won the governor’s mansion in 2018, delivered her remarks with an affable Midwestern folksiness. She focused on explaining how the Democrats have a party brimming with practical policy solutions to problems like health care premiums and decaying infrastructure that can be implemented incrementally.\n",
            "She also called for unity across the two parties — and for Republicans to set aside partisanship for Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate.\n",
            "Sanders, by contrast, had nothing conciliatory to offer.\n",
            "Instead, he spoke with fiery passion about class war between the 1 percent and everybody else. He demanded Medicare-for-all, complete cancellation of student debt, and widespread mobilization in the face of accelerating climate change. He did not appeal to Republicans’ better angels or for bipartisan consensus, and he repeatedly called Trump a liar.\n",
            "In a pivotal election year like this one, Whitmer’s and Sanders’s speeches didn’t just illustrate divergent visions within the Democratic Party about what America should look like. They also served as distinct roadmaps for how the party establishment and the insurgent left wing of the party are inclined to oust Trump from office.\n",
            "And voters will soon have to decide which of these visions they want their party to embrace: the “political revolution” Sanders promised, or the progressive but more incremental vision Whitmer outlined that is embraced by candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden or former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n",
            "Trump’s State of the Union speech, which focused most emphatically on the outward strength of the economy, seemed to indicate that he believes the Sanders approach could very well win out, even if the candidate himself does not.\n",
            "That’s in part because the positions that Sanders advocates for have spread beyond him in mainstream politics, something illustrated by Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley’s response to Trump’s State of the Union on Tuesday night, which she delivered on behalf of the progressive Working Families Party. In that speech, the first-term Congress member spoke forcefully about how Trump has enacted “short-sighted policies that work for the wealthy and powerful few but leave the worker and the immigrant behind.”\n",
            "Strikingly, Trump made sure to bash socialism several times in his speech. He linked it to Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis, and he warned that the sort of government-backed health care Sanders advocates for would be catastrophic and only a boon for unauthorized immigrants. He also went out of his way to mention his update to NAFTA as supported by organized labor — a section of the electorate Sanders has courted — and described his own policies as “pro-worker.” And he didn’t mention impeachment.\n",
            "None of this means that Sanders will win the nomination, or even that Trump thinks he’s harder to beat than a moderate. But it does suggest that the right feels a serious need to fight the ideas that Sanders has made a matter of sustained public debate.\n",
            "Whitmer’s speech and Sanders’s were a study in contrasts.\n",
            "Whitmer delivered her remarks calmly before a quiet audience in the heart of Michigan, a Rust Belt state that Trump narrowly won in 2016 and that was crucial to Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. Whitmer championed her gubernatorial campaign slogan in Michigan — “fix the damn roads” — and used infrastructure investment as a guiding metaphor for practicality and the possibility of bipartisan unity. “All across the country, Democratic leaders are rebuilding bridges,” she said.\n",
            "In addition to discussing Democrats’ infrastructure efforts across the nation, Whitmer focused heavily on health care. She spoke about her experience as a state senator working with Republican lawmakers to expand health care in Michigan under the Affordable Care Act. But she warned against the GOP’s efforts to dismantle the policy and its protections for people with preexisting conditions. “It’s pretty simple. Democrats are trying to make your health care better; Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away,” she said.\n",
            "In short, Whitmer’s earnest celebration of establishment Democrats’ can-do spirit and focus on practical fixes was a summary of a possible Democratic pitch to the average moderate swing voter in a battleground state.\n",
            "Sanders’s remarks were also — quite literally — a pitch to voters. But his angle couldn’t have been more different.\n",
            "Sanders delivered his speech from Manchester, New Hampshire, before a crowd of rowdy supporters. New Hampshire holds its Democratic primary next Tuesday, and given that it’s the first nominating contest that Sanders won in the New Hampshire 2016 primary against Clinton, the state represents a particularly strong base for him.\n",
            "The Vermont senator’s speech kicked off with a cocky crowd-pleaser: “I just listened to Donald Trump’s third, and what I believe to be his very last, State of the Union address.” Sanders then delved into how the economy is “booming” for “Trump and his billionaire friends,” but not for “anybody else.”\n",
            "While Whitmer focused on how the economy could be improved for working Americans through policies like minimum wage increases, Sanders painted a bleaker picture of plutocracy. “The wealthiest people in our country have never ever had it so good, and we are now experiencing more income and wealth inequality than any time in the last 100 years,” he said.\n",
            "And while Whitmer’s speech focused on bread-and-butter issues like improving roads and ensuring clean water, Sanders focused on sweeping, transformative policies like canceling student debt and implementing Medicare-for-all. Whitmer presented solutions as commonsense and technical, while Sanders articulated the conviction that “the American people want a government that is based on the principles of justice and compassion.”\n",
            "Unlike Whitmer, Sanders bluntly discussed Trump’s trade policies and criticized them for doing nothing to prevent corporations from sending jobs overseas. He promised to make efforts to end this practice.\n",
            "In his tone, Sanders alternated between rage at the status quo and snarky skepticism of proposed solutions. When discussing Trump’s State of the Union pledge to protect health coverage of Americans with preexisting conditions, Sanders bellowed, “Really? How gullible do you think the American people are?”\n",
            "As Sanders repeatedly declared Trump a liar, it became clear that he felt the prospect of good-faith negotiation with the GOP was low. Instead, he pushed for the idea of leading a racially diverse mobilization to wrest control of the government from the hands of corporate interests.\n",
            "Like so many of his speeches, Sanders’s address was aimed at progressives and those disenchanted with how the system works. It’s important to note that latter camp, some analysts believe, could include some Trump supporters in battleground states.\n",
            "Trump’s State of the Union address covered a lot of ground. He boasted about low unemployment, he awarded right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he shared grisly stories of crimes allegedly committed by unauthorized immigrants.\n",
            "What was interesting about Trump’s references to his opponents was that he didn’t mention impeachment or the debacle in the Iowa caucus, nor did he take notable strikes at the Democratic Party establishment. Instead, a lot of his criticisms about his political challengers focused on the idea of the rise of an extremist left.\n",
            "For example, Trump invited Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó in a gesture of solidarity with him against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — and as a stand against socialism in the Americas. “The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro,” Trump said.\n",
            "That point is somewhat undercut by the fact that Guaidó would probably be considered a socialist by US standards, but Trump didn’t let that stop him, going on to say, “Socialism destroys nations. But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.”\n",
            "Trump also warned against Medicare-for-all as a socialist nightmare that would take away health care from Americans.\n",
            "“One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans,” Trump said. “To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!”\n",
            "Trump also tied Medicare-for-all and socialism to immigration anxieties among his base. He said Medicare-for-all would subsidize free health care for unauthorized immigrants and act as a lure for more of them to enter the country.\n",
            "“If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left,” Trump declared. “But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens.”\n",
            "In addition to constantly trying to revive the stigma around the s-word (socialism), Trump presented himself as friendly to organized labor. Labor is a key part of the Democratic base and an essential constituency for Sanders’s bid for the Democratic nomination. He described his updated version of NAFTA as “the first trade deal in many years that earned the support of labor unions.”\n",
            "All this would seem preparation to face a Democratic rival who looks more like Bernie Sanders and less like Joe Biden.\n",
            "This doesn’t mean Trump thinks Sanders is a more formidable opponent than, say, Biden in a general election. And it could be argued that he’s experimenting with the strategy of painting the entire Democratic Party as the party of Sanders precisely because he thinks that policies like Medicare-for-all are good flashpoints.\n",
            "Overall, it makes sense as a strategy to use against a party that is becoming increasingly liberal even without Sanders in it. Pressley’s speech, for example, called for ordinary citizens to organize en masse to help bring to fruition a democratic socialist wish list of policies, including a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all.\n",
            "But it is worth noting the symmetry between Sanders’s and Trump’s speeches, and the possibility that Trump takes the socialist threat as dangerous per se. While Whitmer focused on practical solutions, Sanders and Trump both spoke in sweeping, ideological language. While Whitmer longed for bipartisan unity and viewed it as a possibility, Sanders and Trump both have antagonistic, us-versus-them worldviews. While Whitmer seemed sanguine about fixing America, both Sanders and Trump see the world today as harsh and unfair and in need of transformative change.\n",
            "Should Sanders fail to take off in the primaries, perhaps this will all fade. But if his surge continues, this could be a sign of what’s to come: a clash of populisms, from the left and from the right.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "There is a convenient story about Republicans and climate policy circulating in Washington, DC, right now.\n",
            "It goes like this: After years of denying climate science and under pressure from young voters, Republicans have finally turned to the task of designing policy to address climate change. They are developing measures in line with conservative ideals that will focus on markets, shrink the federal government, and avoid picking winners and losers. With such a policy offering, voters will have a choice between two different approaches to solving the climate crisis, rather than a choice between a party that wants to address the problem and one that doesn’t.\n",
            "This story is convenient for conservatives because they have exhausted the strategy of lying about climate science and need something new to replace it. Denial has helped confuse the conversation and delay action in the US for 30 years, but the tide of public opinion is finally turning against it — and so is the opinion of younger Republicans. “Climate denial is a bad political strategy,” says 37-year-old Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL).\n",
            "There is still a hard-core denialist faction, led by hapless clown and one-time Trump transition adviser Steve Milloy. But it has largely been banished, pushed out of the White House, its goofy plan to conduct a science show trial rejected. The strategy now, in the run-up to the 2020 election, is to appear to be doing something on climate.\n",
            "The story is also convenient for mainstream political reporters. Conventional political journalism is built around a both-sides model, in which the journalist’s role is to convey what one side said and what the other side said, offer quotes from their contrasting experts or spokespeople, and leave it to the audience to decide who is more convincing.\n",
            "That’s the model mainstream journalists applied to climate science for years, quoting people like Milloy as well as actual climate scientists. But after decades of effort on the part of climate scientists and advocates, journalists have mostly been cured of that habit. False balance on climate science has been radically reduced, at least in mainstream publications.\n",
            "That leaves “objective” reporters in a difficult situation, though — a story without two sides. For those reporters, word of GOP climate policy comes as a great relief. They can leave the one-sided science story and return to ground they know and understand: two sides with dueling policies, economists, experts, and think-tank reports. In other words, he said, she said.\n",
            "The story is convenient for many denizens of the Beltway. There’s just one problem: It’s mostly horse shit.\n",
            "The one thing it gets right is that Republicans are feeling pressure to change their public stance on climate change. They are groping about for rhetoric and policies that not only can be plausibly said to address climate change but also don’t offend any large bloc of the current conservative coalition, especially the financially supportive and fossil fuel blocs.\n",

            "As for innovation, Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas, the top Republican on the House Science and Technology Committee, recently released a proposal that would double federal funding for basic science. Senate Republicans have backed a bill that would increase funding for research in energy storage. That’s all good.\n",
            "Beyond that, though, when Republicans talk about “clean energy innovation,” they generally mean funding efforts by fossil fuel companies to clean up after themselves (specifically carbon capture, use, and storage).\n",

            "It makes much more sense if viewed as an attempt to simply have something to say when pressed on the vague issue of “climate and environment.” It’s meant to provide the media and disengaged voters with an “other side” on climate policy, without endorsing anything that might upset the fossil fuel companies with which the party is aligned.\n",
            "Notably, the plan includes nothing about solar and wind power, which replace coal and natural gas; nothing about electric vehicles, which replace gasoline vehicles; nothing about efficient buildings or heat pumps, which replace natural gas furnaces; nothing about hydrogen, which can help replace fossil fuels in industrial processes.\n",
            "What could justify these strange priorities? This is the argument Rep. Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican who is leading GOP climate efforts, uses: “Fossil fuels aren’t the enemy. It’s emissions. So let’s devise strategies that are based on emissions strategies, not based on eliminating fossil fuels.”\n",
            "This makes no sense if interpreted literally. The plan Graves was talking about carefully avoids endorsing policies that directly go after emissions, such as a carbon tax or pollution regulations. It avoids setting any particular targets for emission reductions. It avoids mention of most of the technologies and policies with the most potential to reduce emissions, like renewable energy and performance standards.\n",
            "What Graves expressed is not determination to target emissions in general. Rather, he is committed to supporting ways for fossil fuel companies, his party’s most stalwart donors, to clean up their own emissions.\n",
            "Climate policy, he’s trying to say, need not involve shutting down, replacing, or even particularly inconveniencing fossil fuels. That is the core GOP climate message, the reason the party is getting off the sidelines and into the game. It’s there to protect fossil fuels from climate policy.\n",

Discussing the policies in a column for the Port Charlotte Sun, former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, an early climate champion in the House, references “the conservative principles of free markets and limited government.”\n",
            "I am calling a rhetorical foul. Nothing Republicans are proposing on climate policy bears any resemblance to those principles whatsoever.\n",
            "Free-market thinkers like Milton Friedman advocated for reduced government involvement in markets. He believed that the distributed decision-making of market actors was almost always superior to the decision-making of any handful of bureaucrats.\n",
            "Government shouldn’t be stepping in to hurt or help any particular business or technology. That’s where the alleged conservative opposition to “picking winners and losers” comes from. Governments should largely remain neutral; markets are supposed to pick.\n",
            "Over the years, the terms “free market” and “limited government,” like so many conservative principles, have devolved into little more than rhetorical tics, bits of sloganeering that bear no resemblance to actual conservative governance.\n",
            "What conservatives seem to have decided is that regulations, restrictions, or limitations — anything that might upset or inconvenience the corporations generating greenhouse gases — are the bad kind of big government and a bad way of picking winners and losers. Government subsidies, tax credits, and grants — anything that might benefit big corporations — is the good kind of big government and a good way of picking winners and losers.\n",
            "“Democrats like sticks and we like carrots,” said Graves.\n",
            "Washington Examiner reporter Josh Siegel published a story about “how Republican climate advocates won over the conservatives in their party.” The article claims they effectively did it by promising not to support either a carbon tax (what liberals imagine when they think of conservative climate policy) or any regulations to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases. The plan would consist entirely of ... carrots, for the industries they favor.\n",
            "You can call a strategy composed entirely of government spending on various industries many things (say, “reverse-engineered not to offend fossil fuel companies”), but you can’t call it economically conservative. You can’t say it limits the government’s role in markets. And you can’t say it doesn’t pick winners and losers. It explicitly does.\n",

            "The problem is, while Republicans may have found a strategy that can hold together at least some of their coalition, they haven’t found one that can meaningfully address climate change.\n",
            "There are plenty of models that show we will need carbon capture (both industrial and natural) to supplement other efforts to reduce emissions. We probably can’t hit our mid-century targets without it.\n",
            "But there is no model in the world showing emissions falling fast enough with nothing but carbon capture, with fossil fuels continuing their current headlong expansion.\n",
            "The fossil fuels that remain behind after deep decarbonization, the ones that still need their emissions captured and buried, will be a small vestige of the current fossil fuel regime. That is what every credible model shows. That is the cold, hard truth at the heart of the climate dilemma: There is no avoiding the imperative to reduce fossil fuel combustion and the social and economic disruptions that come with it.\n",
            "Current Republican efforts to feign climate policy conspicuously fail to grapple with that truth. They do not take on fossil fuels; on the contrary, they are explicitly designed to support and protect fossil fuels. It amounts to presenting side dishes as the main course and leaving out the entree entirely.\n",
            "It might work to get some both-sides coverage out of the media — that’s not very difficult. But nobody who understands the facts of climate change could possibly view this as a viable plan, or even a good-faith attempt at one.\n",

            "If your name is Karen, Becky, or Chad, you may have noticed a growing trend of people using your name as an insult. Increasingly, “Karen” in particular has emerged as the frontrunner for the average “basic white person name” — a pejorative catchall label for a wide range of behaviors thought to have connections to white privilege. And the recently trending Twitter hashtag #AndThenKarenSnapped has further shifted the “Karen” meme from its nebulous origins toward becoming a mainstream trope.\n",
            "Where a similar insult like “OK Boomer” stereotypes a specific generation, calling someone a “Karen” draws on associations people have built around extremely common names. But the stereotype the name conjures — at least in the US — is limited mainly to white women in their mid-30s or 40s. The archetypal “Karen” is blonde, has multiple young kids, and is usually an anti-vaxxer. Karen has a “can I speak to the manager” haircut and a controlling, superior attitude to go along with it:\n",

            "How exactly did “Karen” become the manager-summoning meme of choice? And is any of this justified?\n",
            "To find out, we talked to a lot of interested parties, including some Karens, the creator of a Karen meme forum, and some naming experts. Here’s everything we learned about what’s in a name.\n",
            "The “Karen” meme has multiple origins, each one using the idea in slightly different ways. But one of the most prominent uses developed on Reddit, thanks to a redditor known for posting amusingly bitter invectives about his ex-wife — posts so amusing, they inspired a high school student to make an entire subreddit, r/FuckYouKaren, devoted to turning his saga into a meme.\n",
            "Karmacop97 is a 17-year-old from Irvine, California. He made the subreddit two years ago as a joke and named it after the now-deleted user account Fuck_You_Karen. At first, karmacop97 told me, the subreddit was “just to compile the lore behind this guy’s relationship,” which he viewed as likely being a parody. The villainous Karen had taken the kids and then the house, both typical parts of the “Karen” meme. Soon, a few thousand redditors had subscribed to make memes based on the redditor’s enraged posts — but when that aggrieved user eventually deleted his account and vanished shortly after the subreddit’s creation, the forum kept growing. Since then, the subreddit has grown from 4,000 redditors to more than 435,000 — and the memes posted there call out all kinds of “Karen”-ish behavior.\n",
            "In particular, the “Karen” has evolved into a figure known for her hypocrisy, rudeness toward working-class staff, and anti-science beliefs.\n",
            "Especially trenchant is the idea — as you can get from this satirical Instagram bio of a spiritual “Karen” — that a stereotypical Karen plays fast and loose with pseudoscience, appropriates identities, may be conservative, and is extremely picky.\n",
            "“A Karen divorces her husband and takes the kids, is a pseudoscientist/anti-vaxxer/flat-earther, an MLM participant, an avid user of Facebook to post shitty motivational posts/’Live Laugh Love,’ and more,“ karmacop97 explained to me. “Our Karen in the wild won’t satisfy all of [these attributes], but she can still be a true Karen.”\n",
            "“She’s the mom in Kroger with her kids asking to speak to the manager,” one Karen, a 29-year-old law student from Oxford, Mississippi, told me in a phone interview. “You do see that basic stereotype sometimes, so it’s kind of funny. It’s a little bit of a commentary on white privilege, perhaps.”\n",
            "On one level, we’ve seen all of this before: After all, resentment toward the upper middle class — what we might call “bourgeoisophobia” — has been around since the middle class itself, often coming most strongly from members of that very middle class. What has changed are Karen’s specific offensive traits: Like all bourgeoisie stereotypes before her, she’s snobbish, prudish, and hypocritical. But now, she’s against science on principle, which is definitely a new twist to the traditional bourgeois model. And the chief way she manifests her class consciousness is not by, say, being a patron of the arts, but by being aggressively rude to the help.\n",
            "“Karen” isn’t alone in receiving this treatment. We’ve increasingly seen a lot of “basic white names” — commonly associated, rightly or wrongly, with Middle American white Protestants — being used in mocking memes that portray them as archetypes rather than individuals. Consider such examples as: “They’re lesbians, Harold,” “Talkback Tammy,” “they’re good dogs Brent,” and, of course, “Becky with the good hair.” White people seem just as likely to make fun of these names as everyone else, especially when it comes to men making fun of women; in the predominantly white men’s rights movement, “Chads,” “Stacys,” and “Beckys” are used to embody and mock people who conform to mainstream gender norms and beauty standards.\n",
            "This trend might have also gotten a boost from social media, according to Dr. I.M. Nick, a nomenclature scholar and former president of the American Name Society. “The general tendency which social media users have been shown to manifest is a high frequency of shortenings and abbreviations,” she said in an email, though she hesitated to speculate on how this tendency might apply to specific names. Combined with what seems to be an underground but culturally established association of “Karen” with rude entitlement — more on that in a minute — it’s possible that social media shorthand could also be one potential origin point for the meme.\n",
            "Oxford Karen told me she’d seen the meme applied to other names like “Susan” and “Zach”— what she describes as “basic white people names.” She compared the meme to the famous Key & Peele “Substitute Teacher” sketch, which inverts/calls out the tendency white people have to stigmatize and mock “ethnic” names by applying that mentality to white names. “I taught at a school with predominantly children of color,” she said, “and that Key & Peele sketch hit home.” In other words, she suggested, there’s potentially an element of reclamation in this trend — payback for decades of “black names” being pejoratively stereotyped, as the sketch highlights:\n",
            "Not everyone agrees with this reclamation assessment. “From a scientific point of view, there is nothing intrinsic about a personal name that makes it ‘black’ or ‘white,’” Dr. Nick told me in an email. “What I think is brilliant about the Key & Peele sketch is that it underscores the fact that personal names are often used to help create and reinforce discriminatory and injurious power differentials within societies.”\n",
            "In other words, names have always played a key role in reinforcing existing societal rules, including power imbalances. The “Karen” meme, in fact, is part of a long tradition — and a pejorative one at that.\n",
            "There’s plenty of historical precedent for using a proper name to stand in for a whole archetype or stereotype of a character. This linguistic use is usually referred to as an eponym; calling someone a “Scrooge” is perhaps the most recognizable example, in reference to a wealth-hoarding, greedy personality. Particularly in the US, racist depictions of fictional characters have often become stand-ins for the negative stereotypes they represent — the “Uncle Tom,” the “Mammy,” the “Stepin Fetchit,” and so on.\n",
            "Cleve Evans is a professor at Bellevue University in Nebraska who studies onomastics — the history and etymology of proper names. “There are myriad examples of words derived from names,” he told me in an email, including as racial or ethnic slurs. Names like “Paddy” and “Mick” functioned as anti-Irish slurs in the 19th century, while “Guido” was a common slur for Italians.\n",
            "Evans said the takeaway wasn’t that “Karen” is an insult now, but rather that names have always been fodder for this kind of use. “They are just another linguistic item that’s possible to be associated with a particular group because of the perception that it’s common among that group,” he said.\n",
            "Nick agreed. “The use of a personal name to refer to an entire group(ing) of people is a long-documented, cross-cultural, linguistic phenomenon that can be attested over many, many centuries,” she said. “The specific names used, the connotations intended, and the peoples involved, vary greatly.”\n",
            "Karen itself was originally a Danish form of “Katherine,” descended from the ancient name “Aikaterine,” which Evans told me was often confused and conflated with a Greek word meaning “purity.” That does lend a bit of accidental irony to the “Karen” meme, with its emphasis on sanctimonious morality, but it had nothing to do with the way the meme came about. In other words, there’s nothing in particular about the meaning of the name “Karen,” or the specific trajectory of the name in pop culture, that lends itself to this kind of pejorative use.\n",
            "What does seem to be new, Evans said, is that names can increasingly stand in for a generational slur — like “boomer” — because there are more names associated with specific age groups and naming fads and trends over the years. Especially among women, he said, “the fads and fashions of the last century have led to many more names that can be linked to a particular age group in addition to names that can be linked to a particular ethnicity.”\n",
            "The name “Karen” peaked as a popular baby name in the US around 1965 — so even though the typical meme “Karen” is from Gen X, the actual majority of women named Karen in the US are boomers. So if there’s any correlation between the name and reality, we can, at most, speculate that the women who’ve wound up giving all Karens a bad name are a group of white senior citizens behaving badly.\n",
            "But speaking of moral hypocrisy ... isn’t this name-calling all just really mean?\n",
            "In Dane Cook’s 2005 comedy album Retaliation, he included a sketch called “The Friend Nobody Likes.” The whole joke of the sketch is that every friends group contains one person everyone else hates. “Karen is always a douchebag,” Cook joked. “Every group has a Karen, and she’s always a bag of douche. And when she’s not around, you just look at each other and go, ‘God, Karen!’”\n",
            "It’s a largely forgotten joke — but Vox editor Karen Turner told me she was subjected to it constantly as a kid. “Imagine being, like, 13 and everyone is constantly quoting this joke to you,” she said. The idea of “the group’s Karen” still turns up once in a while, and may have gotten a boost from 2016’s “antisocial Karen” Nintendo meme, which framed the group’s outlier as a relatable gamer who’d rather play with her new Switch console than engage in social activity. Other culturally well-established uses of “Karen” are also negative — think of ditzy Karen from Mean Girls and meddling Karen from Goodfellas.\n",
            "The current use of the “Karen” meme is almost always to call out the perceived entitlement and rude behavior of white women. But it’s easy to see each of these variants coming back to bite real Karens — and many people think the “Karen” meme itself is just a form of blanket misogyny.\n",
            "It’s a woman and her name is “Karen.” That’s the whole joke\n",
            "“I am sure there are occasions where a complete jerk is deliberately using this new slang term as a way to harass a particular woman named Karen, and I think that should be called out,” Evans said.\n",
            "And sure enough, Karen Han, who writes for Vox sister site Polygon, told me that “sometimes people on Twitter do assume I’m white and respond to tweets that they disagree with that ‘Karen’ meme.” Karen Turner likewise told me she gets people spamming her with the Karen meme on Twitter.\n",
            "Karmacop97 framed this behavior as the exception to the meme rather than the rule — at least on Reddit. “I don’t think it’s particularly sexist,” he said, defending the Karen-focused subreddit, “because the general userbase only calls out specific people, not all women. Also, a few male spinoffs have been posted and done pretty well, where a guy is acting like a Karen (typically Kyle). Anyone who takes it too far as to say all women are like this gets downvotes.”\n",
            "Still, it’s probably hard not to feel the effects of the meme if you are, in fact, a Karen. “It’s definitely annoying to see, as a Karen who doesn’t think of herself as that kind of ‘can I speak to the manager’ attitude nor haircut (and also given that it’s usually defaulted to a middle-aged white woman),” Han said.\n",
            "is there any chance that we will ever land on another default white woman name than \"karen,\" please, my crops are suffering\n",
            "As Turner’s years of being teased because of Dane Cook’s old joke indicate, this name-based mockery can be hurtful — and it’s probably unfair to tell Karen to grow a thicker skin. “Name-based prejudices can leave lasting and deep psychological scars,” Dr. Nick stressed. “Calling people names is sadly one of the first strategies people learn to use to hurt one another. I think most of us, regardless of what our personal names may be, have memories of being hurt, seeing someone hurt, or even hurting someone else by teasing involving a personal name.”\n",
            "It’s tempting to ask what a Karen — or a Chad, Stacey, Susan, Becky, or Kyle — can do to ward off this memetic derision; if, for example, there are ways you can work around or minimize the fallout related to your Basic White Person name. But Dr. Nick told me she felt that question was missing the point. “As a society, we often expect people to somehow modify their behavior to avoid becoming a victim,” she said. The better course, she proposed, would be to “work against the source of the name discrimination and protect those who are harmed by it.”\n",
            "In this case, because the “Karen” meme doubles as a callout method to highlight white privilege, working against the source of the meme also means not only dismantling systems of privilege but becoming more of your individual entitlement. Oxford Karen told me she’s become a little more self-conscious because of the meme. “A couple weekends ago I told my husband he should speak to the manager, and as soon as I said it, I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m such a Karen!’”\n",
            "She told me she usually rolls with the joke. “I try to be funny about it,” she said. “I think it’s a joke about how often the things we think are important, or the things we get all worked up about are just not that serious — especially given the situations other people have to deal with.” Like Oxford Karen, many Karens seem to have accepted that, ironically, the meme isn’t really about them. Some have even started playing along.\n",
            "My kids get endless joy from the fact that my name is middle-aged bossy white lady joke. Glad to see I'm trending! #AndThenKarenSnapped pic.twitter.com/P8OKQOmmw4\n",
            "I’d like to speak to the manager\n",
            "“It’s mildly irritating, but I would probably do the same if the situations were reversed. It’s way better than when I was in middle school,” Turner said. “At least this one isn’t Dane Cook-inspired.”\n",

            "“Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done,” he said.\n",
            "To be fair, the First Step Act, Trump’s landmark criminal justice law, is commendable. More than 3,000 people have been released thanks to the law’s effort to take good behavior while incarcerated into account. And by retroactively applying the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine charges, over 2,000 people received sentencing reductions — 91 percent of them were African Americans, according to the Sentencing Project. 342 people have also been released into the elderly home confinement pilot program.\n",
            "The problem, however, is that the Department of Justice has “attempted to block hundreds of eligible beneficiaries” and send those released back behind bars, according to the Sentencing Project.\n",

Rather than judge their eligibility based on how much crack they possessed when convicted, DOJ argued that they should consider the largest amount of crack the inmate may have admitted to owning. Several federal judges have rejected this interpretation of the law, although at least five have agreed, according to the Post. Some have simply withheld their decision — further delaying the process.\n",
            "DOJ’s challenges to the First Step Act has “a chilling psychological effect on those who have been released or are petitioning for release,” according to a USA Today column from criminal justice reform activists Fred Davie and Julio Medina.\n",
            "“Those benefiting from a sentence reduction cannot live in fear and should be provided with the proper training and tools to reenter society. Unfair treatment could adversely impact their ability to successfully assimilate,” they wrote.\n",
            "And beyond the disruption of the Justice Department, there’s a lot to be accomplished for the First Step Act to reach its full potential. Funding falls far short of the $75 million authorized by Congress. Many prisons lack both the space and money to hold vocational, educational, mental health, and substance abuse programming. And the government has yet to expand the Second Step Act, which promised to help break barriers in employment after release. Until all these issues are addressed, Trump’s criminal justice efforts — and the speeches he makes about them — remain lackluster.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "President Trump pulled out all the stops to put on a show at the State of the Union. And then Speaker Nancy Pelosi stole it by ripping up some pieces of paper.\n",
            "The president pulled some reality show-style tricks out of his hat during Tuesday evening’s address — he gave a young girl a scholarship, reunited a military officer with his family, and presented a medal of honor to a racist and misogynist radio host mid-speech. But the president wasn’t the only one pulling stunts to get some attention — House Speaker Pelosi did, too.\n",
            "After Trump wrapped up his address on Tuesday, Pelosi, who alongside Vice President Mike Pence was seated behind the president during his speech, stood and tore in half the copy of his speech he had handed her at the outset of the evening. Other Democrats had also protested Trump’s address, with many opting not to attend and some walking out mid-speech. But it was Pelosi’s small gesture that cut deepest. She went about her protest calmly, but she made her point.\n",
            "Viewers noticed, and video of Pelosi tearing up Trump’s speech quickly went viral online. The speaker of the House delivered yet another GIFable moment — and, with the flick of a wrist, reminded Americans that she, too, has a point to make, and needs a lot fewer words and braggadocio than the president to make it.\n",
            "Pelosi’s act of defiance is being celebrated on the left as the rejection of a president who has just been impeached and filled his State of the Union address with hateful rhetoric and lies. On the right, it’s being scorned, and Pelosi is being criticized for not taking the “high road” in her actions. (Trump fails to take the high road in most things, but sure.)\n",
            "Yet again, we are debating what civility means — and whether it matters — in such a polarized, high-stakes era. And everybody’s digging in. Case in point: the hashtags trending on Twitter on Wednesday morning, including #PettyPelosi, #PelosiMeltdown, #NancyTheRipper, and #NancyPelosiROCKS.\n",
            "In less than 2 seconds, Nancy Pelosi completely negated trump’s entire speech. Brilliant.    #NancyPelosiROCKS pic.twitter.com/iNcFCeIQ4m\n",
            "This is what building bridges to the American people looks like.. The #PelosiTantrum is a tragic image of how divided our country is. pic.twitter.com/q2GjCEJgwn\n",
            "There are myriad fact-checks of Trump’s speech, and there’s plenty of coverage of the content of what he said, how it was received, and what it meant. And yet here we are the day after, and what’s getting the most airtime is whether Nancy ripping up Don’s papers  was too mean or just mean enough.\n",
            "The reality of the civility debate, whether it’s Pelosi ripping up a speech or a restaurant refusing to serve Sarah Sanders a meal, is that it represents much more. The emotions aren’t about paper or salad — they’re a stand-in for much more deep-seated, complicated disagreements in America. And in a moment of increasing polarization, everything is a proxy for what we believe.\n",
            "If you opted out of watching Trump’s speech on Tuesday, you probably missed the paper rip heard around the world — and everything else that happened in the hour-plus leading up to it.\n",
            "At the start of the evening when Trump entered the chamber, Pelosi offered her hand to the president as he gave her a copy of his speech, but he didn’t take it; perhaps he didn’t see it or chose to ignore it.\n",
            "Trump’s address in and of itself was a doozy — you can read Vox’s winners and losers wrap-up of it here. A lot of the content was typical Trump: touting overstated and false assertions about the economy, fearmongering about immigration and socialism, characteristic bragging.\n",
            "Trump, a former reality television star, also pulled some reality television stunts — he gave a young black girl a scholarship, reunited a military officer with his family, and gave conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who just revealed he has stage 4 lung cancer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. (The first lady was actually the one to put it on him.) A parent whose child was killed in the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting was removed from the audience after an outburst during Trump’s address.\n",
            "Nearly a dozen Democrats skipped the State of the Union in protest of the president, and others walked out as the speech got increasingly bizarre.\n",
            "I walked out of that speech. The lies, the bigotry, and the shameless bragging about taking away food stamps that people depend on to live—it was all beneath the dignity of the office he occupies. Shame on this forever impeached president.\n",
            "Pelosi stayed put, but, as mentioned, she stole the show at the very end by ripping up Trump’s speech as she stood behind him and Pence applauded next to her.\n",
            "The speaker is not apologizing for her decision — and is making clear it was deliberate. “The manifesto of mistruths presented in page after page of the address tonight should be a call to action for everyone who expects truth from the President and policies worthy of his office and the American people,” she said in a statement after the address. “The American people expect and deserve a President to have integrity and respect for the aspirations for their children.”\n",

            "The president, of course, isn’t going to let this one die out, either. As CNN’s Brian Stelter noted, Trump has actually tweeted and retweeted more about Pelosi’s reaction to his speech than about his own speech.\n",
            "If this “controversy” seems familiar, it’s because it is — civility and just how nicely we’re supposed to play with one another is a conversation we have over and over again. Just look at this past weekend: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a surrogate for Bernie Sanders on the 2020 campaign trail, booed Hillary Clinton onstage at a campaign event.\n",
            "BREAKING: At a @BernieSanders rally in Iowa tonight, a leading Sanders’ surrogate @RashidaTlaib led the crowd in booing @HillaryClinton. pic.twitter.com/AKdi2psI2h\n",
            "But the boo (for which Tlaib later apologized) is about more than some pejorative sound we make at sporting events — it’s a proxy for deeper divisions. Clinton has been taking public swipes at Sanders as of late, and there’s still a lot of bad blood between Clinton and Sanders factions from the 2016 presidential election.\n",
            "Sanders acolytes view themselves as slighted in 2016 by a Democratic establishment that stacked the deck for Clinton, tilting everything from the debate schedule to delegate structures against them.\n",
            "The Clinton camp views Sanders and those around him as sore losers who did not wholeheartedly back her in 2016. And beyond Clinton versus Sanders, specifically, the boo results from competing visions on the left of which policies to push for and how to govern: Do you take a moderate approach to try to get things done, or do you try to overthrow the system?\n",
            "For Democrats, Pelosi’s gesture was an f-you to a president who just minutes before told a blatant lie to people worried about losing their health care and gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a man who has spent years pumping racism, sexism, and hate into the American public’s veins. It’s a small but forceful slight to a Republican Party that’s in all likelihood about to acquit a president for impeachable offenses, not even bothering to hear from witnesses. Progressives see Trump as a nefarious and dangerous figure, and Pelosi’s paper tear is a manifestation of that.\n",
            "Republicans, on the other hand, hold it up as another example of liberal hysteria (though Pelosi, if nothing else, seems exceedingly calm) and over-the-top rhetoric around the president. And they’re crying foul on the civility front — sure, many of them spent years saying Barack Obama was secretly born outside the United States and refusing to even hold a hearing for his Supreme Court nominee, but now they’re horrified at the indignity of the left. To be sure, some of the outrage is disingenuous. But there’s no denying that Republicans have plenty of deep political disagreements with Democrats.\n",
            "The civility debate won’t be going away, so when it bubbles up again, it’s important to remember what’s at the root of it. When Trump officials are getting booed out of restaurants, the conversation isn’t just about whether they’re getting a comfortable meal — it’s about whether the immigrant families they’re separating at the border are able to eat together.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21123591/margot-robbie-birds-of-prey-review\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "An essential moment in the superhero movie genre is when our hero doesn’t believe they’re a hero yet. Something, usually something horrible, has to trigger and inspire the hero to be something better — something super. Batman witnessed his parents die. Spider-Man wasn’t there for his Uncle Ben when he needed him most. Iron Man saved the world over and over, and finally sacrificed himself in his last attempt to do so. John Wick’s puppy was murdered.\n",
            "For Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) in the energetic Quinn breakout flick Birds of Prey, this pivotal moment happens during a painful breakup with the villainous Joker.\n",
            "Rating: 3 out of 5\n",
            "“Mr. J” is abusive (obvious to everyone but Harley) and hogs the spotlight. She’s done living in the shadows and being seen as the girlfriend, something she finally realizes after getting dumped. The last-straw insult after Harley Quinn is broodily single is when she overhears a flock of other friends talking behind her back, saying how, at the end of the day, she’ll be back in the Joker’s arms and back to having no identity of her own.\n",
            "The rest of the movie isn’t as simple and clean as the setup of Harley’s revelation-bringing split, though. Much of Birds of Prey features Quinn, in a Deadpool-like fashion, narrating her own backstory and providing slapdash dossiers about other characters to explain how she and a band of street-level superheroic women are all connected to a flamboyant, psychologically brittle villain, a diamond, and a foster child.\n",
            "All this exposition begins to feel as if director Cathy Yan and screenwriter Christina Hodson were trying to find ways to make this movie be more than an excuse to watch Harley Quinn and friends dole out pounds of stylish violence on well-deserving men for almost two hours. And there’s nothing wrong with that.\n",
            "Yet with how effective Bird of Prey’s multiple, thrilling action sequences are, it would’ve been better to cut some of those flabbier attempts at substance. Instead, the film would be better served by fully leaning into the uncomplicated, John Wick-like satisfaction of devilishly cool women unleashing crunching brutality — like breaking a single leg in three different directions — in sublimely entertaining and orchestrated fight scenes. There’s nothing wrong with a movie that favors style over substance, and Birds of Prey is a prime example of how sometimes substance is overrated.\n",
            "Birds of Prey is, at its heart, a fresh start for Harley Quinn. On the big screen, Quinn last appeared in the horrendous Suicide Squad, with Robbie’s performance cited as the best thing about the flop. Jared Leto’s Joker was often cited as one of the worst parts, and addition by subtraction, story-wise and Leto-wise, feels like the credo for Birds of Prey.\n",
            "Having gone through a breakup with the Joker (Leto’s, not Phoenix’s), Quinn finds herself in the crosshairs of every person she’s ever wronged. She no longer has the Joker’s protection, signaling to every miscreant that she’s now fair game.\n",
            "Robbie makes the difficult task of bringing a character like Quinn to life look fairly effortless. Unlike many of DC Entertainment’s superheroes (think: Wonder Woman) and supervillains (think: Phoenix’s Joker), there’s an edge of camp and crassness to Quinn— oftentimes cartoonish humor undercuts her violence and horror. Unlike in Harley’s animated roots and comics appearances, live action doesn’t lend itself as easily to those visual gags, leaving Robbie to do the heavy lifting of injecting the right amount of comedy into Quinn’s mania. Sometimes she loosens her face into a smile amid bone-breaking violence, or sharpens her features into a pout as Quinn completely and uncomfortably misreads a situation.\n",
            "As the crime boss Roman Sionis, Ewan McGregor is operating at the same level as Robbie, having so much fun playing an impossibly charismatic fancy daddy of a villain. His “superpower” is being very rich, and he’s ready to pounce on Quinn’s lapsed criminal immunity. Sionis is totally grossed out at messiness, loves Botox, and also has a sociopathic quasi-boyfriend henchman in Victor Zsasz (a platinum-haired Chris Messina).\n",
            "McGregor spends much of the movie flipping his wrist to signal a murder like a conductor directing an orchestra, lounging in silk robes, dancing to no music, and saying the word “birdy” over and over in reference to his lackeys. He just about slinks away with the entire movie, making you wish his Roman and Messina’s Zsasz had their own Warner Bros. supervillain prequel where they get to be gay and do crimes.\n",
            "Caught in the middle of Quinn and Roman’s pursuit of her are Roman’s lounge singer Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), police detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), an assassin named Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and a street urchin named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). They end up grouping together to form the Birds of Prey, a crime-fighting group cobbled together out of circumstance. Each of these actresses makes their heroes her own, just like Robbie does — Smollett’s Black Canary is instantly likable despite her steeliness, Perez gives Montoya a relatable weariness and indomitable dignity, and Winstead’s Huntress is delightfully awkward.\n",
            "The problem arises when the movie goes about connecting all these disparate characters in an inefficient way. There’s a lot of backtracking and time-jumping, a way the movie emphasizes Quinn’s attention span-less style of storytelling. But at times it also feels like the only way to tell such a roundabout plot. The movie would have been so much better had it simplified its story by half.\n",
            "Birds of Prey’s most thrilling aspect, instead, is its stylish disregard for pain and the human body. As the director, Yan isn’t particularly concerned with showing you the physical toll of superhero-ing, like the way we see Captain America wince and strap his shield to his bloody, broken arm in Endgame for one more fight.\n",
            "Instead, Yan shows us how balletic, mesmerizing, and gruesome it is to get into a scrap with these powerful women.\n",
            "The movie’s fight scenes are like highlight reels in themselves, mashing together visual artistry with bone-crunching savagery. Each woman has her own style of fighting, from Harley’s sloppy ability to turn anything into a weapon to the precision of Huntress’s almost silly crossbow to Black Canary’s speedy street style.\n",
            "One memorable sequence finds Quinn amid a jailbreak. Because we’re in Quinn’s point of view, every one of her moves — gunshots, grenades, pistol whipping — comes with bursts of confetti or mustard-tinted smoke or bright paint. It’s perhaps a way to signal to us that Quinn can’t see the mortal consequences of her actions. And somehow, even in this technicolor chaos of Quinn obliterating a daisy chain of murderous thugs, the fight is never confusing, and even dips into physical comedy at multiple inflection points.\n",
            "Every part of it works, and the fight represents the movie at its finest.\n",
            "It’s frustrating, though, to see a movie so tight and entertaining in its action and so gangly in exposition. The result is a rambunctious women-driven revenge thriller, filled with tentpole moments of crackling verve that is knit together by flimsy exposition and voiceovers. I suppose Yan was aiming for something more ambitious with Birds of Prey’s narrative attempt at Quinn’s loose empowerment story. But I’d be more interested in seeing the purely action-driven, fight-scene-after-fight-scene music video of a movie she avoided making.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "President Donald Trump opened his State of the Union speech touting strong economic conditions for black Americans and their decorous record serving their country — before later announcing in the same speech that he would award a racist radio talk show host the Presidential Medal of Freedom and concluding on a very whitewashed version of US history.\n",
            "It was a classic bit of Trumpian whiplash. The president loves to talk out of one side of his mouth, touting the economic gains for many Americans, including black people, while he’s been in the White House, before he starts talking out of the other, outlining a revanchist and white-centric worldview that thoroughly informs his politics.\n",
            "As he opened his speech reviewing the state of the US economy, Trump quickly turned his attention to the fortunes of minorities — something he’s been emphasizing more in the runup to his 2020 reelection campaign.\n",
            "“The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low,” Trump said. “African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.” (As always with Trump, those stats are a little more complicated than he let on: The improvement really started under Barack Obama.)\n",
            "A bit later, he singled out one of the guests at the speech as well: Charles McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, the first black fighter pilots.\n",
            "But a few token words can’t erase Trump’s history of birtherism, his equivocation between white nationalists and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, or many of the other words he’s said (“shithole countries”) and deeds he’s done (housing discrimination in the ’70s).\n",
            "And later in his speech, Trump reminded the audience that any aspirational rhetoric on race coming from him is probably empty.\n",
            "First, Trump announced he would give Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host in attendance who was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is, as Trump noted, the highest civilian honor in the United States.\n",
            "“Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country,” Trump said. “Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.”\n",
            "Trump is far from the first president to bestow this honor on a, shall we say, unsavory character — George W. Bush, for example, chose a radio talk show host with retrograde views on race for the same award.\n",
            "As Vox’s Laura McGann reviewed, Trump took the mighty stage of the State of the Union address, before Congress and a national television audience, and gave “one of America’s most prominent racists” official government recognization.\n",
            "Here is, via McGann, an abridged history of Limbaugh’s comments on race:\n",
            "Limbaugh, like Trump, was a longtime birther. Trump was an early birther adopter and kept spreading the conspiracy nine months into his presidency.\n",
            "Limbaugh’s racist rants continued beyond the 2008 election and started long before.\n",
            "- In 1990, Newsday reported that Limbaugh snapped at a black caller who confronted him, saying, “Take the bone out of your nose and call me back.” (Limbaugh denies he said this.)\n",
            "- In 2007, Limbaugh joked he was “singing a song in my head here during the break: ‘Barack, the Magic Negro, doo doo do doo.’”\n",
            "- In 2004, he suggested that professional basketball players were criminals: “You just gotta be who you are, and I think it’s time to get rid of this whole National Basketball Association. Call it the TBA, the Thug Basketball Association, and stop calling them teams. Call ’em gangs,” he said.\n",
            "- Three years later, Limbaugh described professional football players the same way. “Look, let me put it to you this way. The NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.”\n",
            "- In 2011, he mocked a speech by the president of China, saying on air, “Hu Jintao was just going, ‘Ching cha. Ching chang cho chow. Cha chow. Ching cho. Chi ba ba ba. Kwo kwa kwa kee.” Limbaugh continued this at length, then said, “Nobody was translating, but that’s the closest I can get.”\n",
            "- In 2016, Limbaugh claimed that Obama’s race “amplified malcontent operations like Black Lives Matter. It gave rise to a thugocracy, and nobody had the guts to speak out against it for fear of what would happen to them.”\n",
            "The list of examples goes on and on.\n",
            "And then came the concluding section of Trump’s speech.\n",
            "“As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes,” Trump said as he wound down his address. “This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life.”\n",
            "He then ran through some of that rich history and the characters who shaped it. As he named the illustrious names of US history — Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, Neil Armstrong — he found time for a few black faces (Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman), but he was clearly evoking a very specific kind of history.\n",
            "“This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo,” Trump said. “The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the earth.”\n",
            "As Vox’s Jessica Machado wrote, Trump was telling a capital-W White version of American history:\n",
            "In his retelling of history, the president not only erased the millions of Native peoples prior to Columbus’s arrival in 1492, but suggested that their lands, livelihoods, and existence were something to be tamed and conquered. “Our ancestors,” as Trump referred to, were these settlers — white people from England and Europe. More recent immigrants were denigrated as “wicked human traffickers” and “illegals” in other parts of Trump’s speech. The nearly 40 percent of Americans who are not white apparently did not bear mentioning in Trump’s history.\n",
            "In his revisionist telling of the “founding” of America, Trump also completely erased slavery. According to Trump, after taming the Wild West, and “lifting millions from poverty, disease, and hunger” (Indigenous people not among them), these ancestors also “laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers — and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history.”\n",
            "Many historians would argue that it was not the white colonists who built the foundations of this country, but those they had enslaved. The White House, the Capitol, Wall Street, and many of our Ivy League universities were built with slave labor. America became a global economy because of slave labor. It is an ugly history, but an undeniable one: The bodies of the enslaved — abused and routinely murdered — helped colonists build the country we know today.\n",
            "Trump is notorious for these sorts of dog whistles — and more overt displays of racism.\n",
            "As study after study has shown, Trump won in 2016 in large part because he attracted white voters who felt some kind of race-based resentment or alienation. He’ll need those voters again in 2020.\n",
            "But that is also a limited pool of support, and Trump lost minority voters by huge margins. He and his campaign have made a big show of trying to attract black voters heading into his reelection bid.\n",
            "“We’re going to campaign for every last African-American vote in 2020,” Trump said in November 2019. “We’ve done more for African-Americans in three years than the broken Washington establishment has done in more than 30 years.”\n",
            "Now, so far, the effects of any Trump black outreach have been minimal. Gallup pegged his support among black voters at 10 percent just a few months ago. Other surveys have found black voters overwhelmingly support a Democrat, any Democrat, against Trump in the 2020 election and most black Americans think Trump is racist.\n",
            "Still, even shaving just a bit off of those margins could go a long way toward helping him win a second term. That’s why we will continue to hear overtures like those Trump made at his State of the Union speech. But he also seems likely to continue reminding voters, of all types, how much of his political movement is founded explicitly in white identity. It seems he just can’t help it.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó appeared as a guest at the State of the Union on Tuesday, with President Donald Trump touting him as the “true and legitimate president of Venezuela.”\n",
            "Trump’s move was likely intended to boost Guaidó on the international stage, as the Venezuelan politician’s attempts to oust President Nicolás Maduro from power have continued to flounder.\n",
            "Last January, Guaidó declared himself the rightful leader of Venezuela, and the United States and many other Western allies, including Canada and the European Union, endorsed him. But after a failed coup in April, declining support among Venezuelans, and reports of corruption scandals within the opposition he leads, US support for his efforts has waned.\n",
            "Meanwhile, Venezuela’s political and economic crises persist, and have morphed into a humanitarian catastrophe as millions have fled to neighboring countries. It is on the verge of becoming the world’s largest refugee crisis, surpassing Syria.\n",
            "Guaidó, though, is trying to reinvigorate support for his campaign against Maduro, and just embarked on a world tour to boost those alliances. He’s reportedly been eager to get much-needed facetime with Trump — and, in the end, managed to snag a State of the Union invite instead. On Wednesday, the White House announced that the president would also meet with Guaidó.\n",
            "Guaidó was greeted with enthusiastic applause during the State of the Union, but this renewed attention by Trump, so far, looks unlikely to alter the political stalemate in Venezuela.\n",
            "But it certainly gave Trump an opportunity to boast about his foreign policy, and to once again use Venezuela’s crisis to decry the dangers of socialism. It’s a tactic he’s used before, in an attempt to denigrate his 2020 Democratic opponents.\n",
            "“As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere,” Trump boasted, citing the administration’s policies against Cuba (reversing Obama-era opening), Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\n",
            "On Venezuela, Trump said that Maduro is “an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro’s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken.”\n",
            "Guaidó, Trump said, was the man who would do so. “Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland,” Trump told Guaidó as he stood in the gallery. “Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.”\n",
            "Trump has repeatedly used Maduro has a foil to rail against socialism, in an attempt, as Vox’s Alex Ward put it, “to scare Republican voters in Florida and elsewhere that the Democrats are a bunch of socialists that could soon turn American into a Venezuela-like hellscape.”\n",
            "Trump wasn’t that explicit in his State of the Union, but the subtext was there. And though he painted Guaidó as the antidote, he did forget to mention that Guaidó is himself a socialist and his leadership of Venezuela has been backed by the Council of the Socialist International. They, too, have rejected Maduro.\n",
            "The United States has imposed tough sanctions on Maduro and his allies; so far, though, Maduro remains entrenched. And one area the United States could help Venezuelans in — as Trump put it, “their righteous struggle for freedom!” — would be to help the thousands of Venezuelans who are fleeing the precarious conditions in the country.\n",
            "Lawmakers, including prominent Republicans, have called on the Trump administration to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans fleeing Maduro’s regime. So far, the Trump administration hasn’t taken action.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21123977/susan-collins-trump-impeachment-acquittal\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "The rationale Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) gave for voting for acquit President Donald Trump aged poorly before she even had a chance to officially cast it.\n",
            "Following a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday in which she announced she’ll vote to acquit, Collins told Norah O’Donnell of CBS that she believes Trump “has learned from this case” and “will be much more cautious in the future.”\n",
            "Getting impeached “is a pretty big lesson,” Collins said — the implication being that Trump will be chastened going forward from trying to pervert diplomacy into an opposition research opportunity, as he did with the Ukrainian government.\n",
            "CBS NEWS EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) tells @NorahODonnell that she will vote to acquit Pres. Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, arguing that she believes \"the president has learned from this case.” https://t.co/nYzE817WQS pic.twitter.com/Lp3fojLALa\n",
            "Collins’s hopefulness about Trump changing his behavior is absurd on his face. Trump has spent five months insisting that a phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that’s at the heart of his impeachment — one in which Trump implicitly linked military aid to Ukraine with the country helping him with investigations of his political rivals — is “perfect.”\n",
            "It’s well established that Trump isn’t big on apologies or remorse. Just look at the circumstances surrounding the Zelensky call. It happened on July 25 — one day after special counsel Robert Mueller wound down his investigation of Trump by testifying to Congress and saying Trump could be indicted after his term for obstructing justice because of his interference with the Russia investigation.\n",
            "But instead of responding to the end of the Russia investigation by cooling his jets, Trump was on the phone with the Ukrainian president the very next day trying to solicit political favors — the very same conduct that fueled suspicions about his Russia dealings in the first place.\n",
            "So Collins’s rationale was hard to buy to begin with. And as if on cue, Trump told reporters during an off-the-record lunch on Tuesday that, indeed, he doesn’t feel he has any lessons to learn from getting impeached.\n",
            "Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker have the details for the Washington Post:\n",
            "The president covered a wide range of topics at the luncheon.\n",
            "When he was asked about Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) saying he had learned a lesson during impeachment, the president said he’d done nothing wrong: “It was a perfect call.”\n",
            "While Collins claims to have principled reasons for voting to acquit Trump — she told O’Donnell that “I don’t believe that the behavior alleged reaches the high bar in the Constitution for overturning an election and removing a duly-elected president” — it’s also the case that she’s running for reelection and facing perhaps her toughest race yet, and in that position she can’t afford to cross the undisputed leader of her party. (Collins partially walked back her CBS comments on Wednesday, telling a Maine reporter that “hopes” would’ve been a better word for her to use than “believes” when it comes to Trump learning lessons.)\n",
            "But Collins’s desire to win another term doesn’t totally explain why she’s pushing such an implausible talking point. On Meet the Press last Sunday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who’s retiring next January, deployed the same rationale to justify his vote for Trump’s acquittal.\n",
            "“if a call like that gets you an impeachment, I would think he’d think twice before doing it again,” Alexander said, and he even stuck by that claim after Chuck Todd pressed him to explain “what example in the life of Donald Trump has he been chastened.”\n",
            "“I haven’t studied his life that close,” Alexander replied, after a pause.\n",
            "ALEXANDER: If a call like that gets you an impeachment, I would think he'd think twice before doing it againCHUCK TODD: What example is there from Trump's life of him ever being chastenedALEXANDER: ... I haven't studied his life that close pic.twitter.com/UFyf4zA69X\n",
            "Indeed, few if any examples of Trump being chastened could be cited, and the timeline of the Ukraine scandal indicates it’s folly for Republicans to believe he won’t try to cheat again.  But partisanship is a hell of a drug.\n",

            "In August 2019, she also had four rose tattoos. She was a heroin addict for seventeen years, and she gets a rose for every year that she stays sober — though in August, she’d actually been sober for five years, not four.\n",
            "“The first year that I was clean, I didn’t do it, because for me the first year ... it was easier,” she explained, “Not that it wasn’t hard, but I was surrounded. I was structured. I was very followed.”\n",

            "But differences in taste aside, the two were clearly very close. During our interview, Natasha helped her daughter with a bouncy ball she’d made at a nearby booth, and they laughed together as it bounced around.\n",
            "The booth was part of a back-to-school fair at a charitable organization in Montreal. Kids could make bouncy balls, but they also got free winter boots, free backpacks, and a free set of school supplies: glue and colored pencils and erasers and notebooks. Even a lunchbox.\n",
            "That was definitely helpful for Natasha. But it didn’t come close to covering all the costs of raising her daughter. Kids are expensive, after all. They need clothes and food and health care and day care and any number of other costly things.\n",

            "President Donald Trump addressed Congress on Tuesday night for his last State of the Union address before the 2020 election, claiming in an appeal to voters that, over the past three years, he had helped stage the “Great American Comeback.”\n",
            "A transcript follows:\n",
            "Related\n",
            "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens:\n",
            "Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.\n",
            "The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\n",
            "In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!\n",
            "I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!\n",
            "The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise.\n",
            "From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\n",
            "Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration.\n",
            "The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.\n",
            "And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America’s great economic success.\n",
            "The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.\n",
            "African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.\n",
            "The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years — and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.\n",
            "The veterans’ unemployment rate dropped to a record low.\n",
            "The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.\n",
            "Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history.\n",
            "A record number of young Americans are now employed.\n",
            "Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.\n",
            "In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.\n",
            "Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent — 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.\n",
            "Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!\n",
            "Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something every country in the world is looking up to. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.\n",
            "All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 percent, 80 percent, 100 percent and even more.\n",
            "Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!\n",
            "Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family — he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Keep up the great work, Tony.\n",
            "Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.\n",
            "Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.\n",
            "Likewise, we are restoring our Nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA. The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.\n",
            "One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA’s adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA — only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.\n",
            "The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that. Fairness and reciprocity. I say that finally, because it has been many years that we were treated fairly on trade. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions.\n",
            "I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America.\n",
            "For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed. At the same time, we have the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: That’s enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is exactly what we are doing. We are rebuilding our country.\n",
            "As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who abuses his people.\n",
            "But tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much. Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\n",
            "To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment. And it is made right here in the USA. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It’s called the Space Force. Very important.\n",
            "In the gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman. What he wants so badly — 13 years old — he is an eighth grader from Arizona. Ian, please stand up. Ian has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. Most people look up at space. Ian says I want to look down on the world.\n",
            "But sitting behind Ian tonight is his greatest hero of them all, Charles McGee, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen — the first black fighter pilots — and he also happens to be Iain’s great-grandfather. Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you. Thank you, sir.\n",
            "From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future.\n",
            "Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!\n",
            "The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah’s mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.\n",
            "Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. But Janiyah, I have some good news for you. I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!\n",
            "Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act — because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.\n",
            "Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the “Be Best” initiative — to support a safe and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children.\n",
            "My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.\n",
            "My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation’s high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.\n",
            "To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n",
            "A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security. Always.\n",
            "The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\n",
            "But as we work to improve Americans’ healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!\n",
            "Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States — their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you think we should defend American patients and seniors, stand with me to pass legislation to prohibit free healthcare for illegal aliens!\n",
            "This will be a tremendous boon to our already strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed.\n",
            "My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.\n",
            "And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately.\n",
            "With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic — drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent — and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.\n",
            "Protecting Americans’ health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\n",
            "We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade.\n",
            "Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, congratulations. Thank you, Kathryn.\n",
            "As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke’s hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors — and the prayers of her parents — little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are with us tonight.\n",

            "Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\n",
            "Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York’s sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE’s detainer request, his victim would be alive today.\n",

In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California’s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.\n",
            "Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims.\n",

            "Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May — dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.\n",
            "Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol — and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand — a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol.\n",

This includes Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. We have many in the pipeline.\n",
            "My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!\n",

On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: ”I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage. ”I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sandbox, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad.” On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever. He is looking down on you now. Thank you.\n",
            "The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime’s most ruthless butcher.  He murdered thousands of American servicemembers in Iraq. As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.\n",
            "Our message is you will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!\n",
            "In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short recovery. It can all go quickly — let’s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.\n",

It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home!\n",
            "War places a heavy burden on our Nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children — 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. For the past seven months, her husband has been in Afghanistan for seven months on his fourth deployment. Amy’s kids have not seen their father’s face in many months. Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace — and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy.\n",

This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more.

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/5/21120404/police-departments-artificial-intelligence-public-records\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "There are a host of artificial intelligence and algorithm-based technologies that the New York Police Department could be using, but few know exactly what’s in the NYPD’s arsenal. As multiple sources told Recode, trying to get the department, the largest in the United States, to reveal what surveillance tools they use is a process full of opacity and shifting legal arguments. Basically, if you want to know how the NYPD might be using tech to police your neighborhood, tough luck.\n",
            "I learned this lesson firsthand this past December when looking into various artificial intelligence-based technologies I thought the police department could be using. Like many journalists, I filed a request for public records, which is a wonky-but-nonetheless-simple process for requesting information from the government. My query included documents like contracts and correspondence related to 21 security companies. My hope was that those documents, if they existed, could give me a better sense of what type of artificial intelligence the NYPD might be using. One technology that particularly interested me was gun detection software, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically notify you when a brandished firearm appears in a video feed.\n",
            "But just over 48 hours after filing it, my entire request was rejected because, the NYPD said, those documents would reveal “non-routine techniques and procedures” — with no elaboration. So that same day, I appealed, and about a week later I heard back from the department. Now I had a new explanation: Answering my requests could reveal these companies’ trade secrets, harm their “competitive position,” or impact “imminent contract awards or collective bargaining negotiations.” If I wanted to fight further, I’d need to go to court.\n",
            "It turns out I, a beginner in requesting public records, wasn’t the only one to get such an opaque and frustrating response. Several government transparency advocates interested in law enforcement tech told me they, too, have faced issues when trying to get records from the NYPD. Some have had to sue for these records. That matters because police departments are increasingly making use of new and untested types of surveillance technology. These tools aren’t only expensive to the taxpayers, they also raise concerns about algorithmic bias and threats to civil liberties.\n",
            "Consider predictive policing tools, which NYPD representatives described in an article in 2017. This software uses historical data, such as police reports, to predict future crime.\n",
            "“[That data] could be arrest records. It could be conviction records. It could — depending on the kind of predictive policing system [because] different ones operate in different ways — it could be the anticipated weather for that day. It could be school closures,” Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said.\n",
            "But knowing exactly what input data a predictive policing system is using is critical. One of the major concerns about these tools is that they’ll exacerbate racial bias, and researchers have found that predictive policing tools can end up factoring in “dirty data,” including data that reflects conscious and implicit bias, as well as manipulated and even unlawful police practices.\n",
            "The NYPD has still not provided the Brennan Center with documents related to the input data these algorithms use. The department did tell the Daily Beast last year that it uses “complaints for seven major crime categories, shooting incidents, and 911 calls for shots fired.” (The department outlined just one example in its 2017 article: 911 calls for shots fired and a database of previous shootings can be used by an algorithm to predict future gun violence). But the Brennan Center filed its public records request for that information back in 2018, and the organization is still waiting on an appeal, filed in November, for those documents. That follows an earlier public records request the nonprofit filed in 2016 about predictive policing, which took two years — and a lawsuit — to ultimately get fulfilled.\n",
            "Of course, the agency could just give advocates, journalists, and the public more information about their practices to begin with.\n",
            "“There is absolutely no law today that stops the NYPD from voluntarily putting every one of these systems on their website,” said Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP). “The problem is, we have a police department with a decades-long history of trying to do everything within its power to hide its operations from public scrutiny.”\n",
            "The NYPD did not respond to my repeated request for comment on this article.\n",
            "STOP and the DC-based digital rights group Upturn are now suing to force the NYPD to turn over records related to so-called “mobile device forensic tools,” which could allow an officer to access data and meta-data from your phone, including your device’s digital history, location data, and types of encrypted communications. Cahn said his group is also preparing another legal proceeding to force the NYPD to hand over documents related to other potential biometric surveillance.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology is still wrapped up in litigation stemming from a public records request related to the NYPD’s purchase of facial recognition technology that was filed in 2016. And there are certainly more examples of the NYPD being taken to court for records, and still others are waiting to hear back about their initial inquiries. For instance, Jerome Greco, an attorney who focuses on digital forensics at Legal Aid, filed a request for documents related to the NYPD’s use of drones on Thanksgiving Day last year. He was told to expect a response in April.\n",
            "“I do think it’s safe to say that the NYPD stands out, based on our experience and the experience of other folks that we talk to,” Levinson-Waldman said. “It does seem like the fairly uniform experience is that it is very hard to get documents out of the NYPD through a just regular FOIL (Freedom of Information Law) process.”\n",
            "There is some data to back up these claims. A search of MuckRock, an online database that allows people to publicly post and track their public records requests, shows that the New York Police Department has completed less than half of the number of public records requests that the Chicago Police Department has, despite receiving more requests. It’s worth noting that it’s not a scientific comparison; MuckRock has tracked only a fraction of overall requests to the NYPD (just over 500), while NYC’s Open Records data says the department has, overall, received more than 40,000 requests since 2017.\n",
            "“Most agencies are not that open to sharing that information, but the NYPD is more egregious. They’ve been the ones to make legal claims that no other agency really makes,” Rashida Richardson, the policy director of the AI Now Institute, explained.\n",
            "In fact, the NYPD has even tried to use a so-called “Glomar” response to public records requests about its potential surveillance of the phones and social media of protesters (earlier last year, a New York court said “not this time”). The “Glomar” response is an argument typically used by federal agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to reject a request for records by neither confirming nor denying that they actually exist.\n",
            "“This is a police department that we know has a history of acting in ways that have a disproportionate impact on communities of color and individuals of color in New York,” Levinson-Waldman said. “It’s really akin to a counterterrorism department, and so I think it’s especially critical to understand how the police department is functioning.”\n",
            "Consider the NYPD’s “Domain Awareness System,” a surveillance platform it developed alongside Microsoft in 2012 which the department itself describes as utilizing “the largest networks of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological sensors in the world.”\n",
            "The NYPD is known to use other AI- and algorithm-based surveillance tools. For instance, the department also uses an AI-based software called Patternizr that mines through police case files to find crime patterns. That’s a tool they introduced in 2016 but only publicly revealed last year.\n",
            "The extent to which the NYPD fails to fulfill public records requests limits how much we really know about what the department is doing. After all, much of the information we have about law enforcement’s existing surveillance tools is obtained through public records requests. We know how the NYPD uses facial recognition databases in large part thanks to a public records request that Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology lawyers had to fight for in court.\n",
            "But the legal mechanism seems increasingly insufficient and slow when transparency-wary departments like the NYPD are buying ever-more-powerful surveillance tech. That’s left some looking for better ways to get information about these tools. For instance, some transparency advocates tried to push New York City to reveal all the automated decision systems used by the government as part of a novel task force on the city government’s use of algorithms. (The city offered up a measly five examples.)\n",
            "Others point to laws that would force these departments to be more upfront. Levinson-Waldman and Cahn both support the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act, a proposed New York City bill that would force the department to disclose more information about the types of surveillance technology it uses.\n",
            "“To some extent, it would relieve the pressure on having to rely on public records requests and lawsuits,” Levinson-Waldman told Recode.\n",
            "Cahn said the bill is part of a broader effort initiated in 2016 and organized by the American Civil Liberties Union called the Community Control over Police Surveillance that urges local governments to take greater control over the surveillance technologies acquired by their law enforcement agencies.\n",
            "“The reason public oversight is so important is because agencies can get these decisions deeply wrong when left to their own devices,” said Cahn. “The NYPD could waste millions of dollars on tools which simply automate discrimination against communities and lead to false arrests of black and brown New Yorkers without any accountability or oversight.”\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "President Trump largely glossed over health care in his State of the Union speech, but he did try to put one item on Congress’s to-do list: He promised if the body passed a bipartisan bill to reduce prescription drug costs, “I will sign it into law immediately.”\n",
            "It was a statement that didn’t sit too well with some House Democrats, who passed comprehensive legislation to cut drug prices just a few weeks ago. So a few of them stood up, held three fingers in the air, and shouted “H-R-3” (the number of their bill) — interrupting Trump for a few awkward moments in the middle of his speech.\n",
            "Trump claimed that he’s taking on big Pharma.House Democrats chanted ‘HR-3’ in response, referencing the bill they passed that would lower drug prices. HR-3 currently sits in Mitch McConnell's legislation 'graveyard.' pic.twitter.com/iRy2enChvS\n",
            "Democrats and Republicans actually do agree on the need to reduce drug costs. But not on how to do it. So despite Trump’s overtures, and the forceful Democratic response, it’s going to be hard for anything to get done.\n",
            "The House bill — H.R.3 — has a few mechanisms for reducing prescription drug prices, but most notably, it would allow the US health department to directly negotiate the prices it will pay for up to 250 drugs every year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the bill would save Medicare up to $450 billion over 10 years because of those new negotiating powers. CBO has also projected about eight fewer drugs (out of an expected 300 over 10 years) would come to the market in the next decade because of the decrease in revenues for drug makers.\n",
            "Despite Trump’s promises on the 2016 campaign trail that he would support proposals allowing Medicare drug negotiations, the White House threatened to veto the House plan. They called it a plan to institute government “price controls,” and said it would limit access to medicine, a favored talking point of the pharmaceutical lobby.\n",
            "Even without this veto threat, H.R.3 is expected to be dead-on-arrival in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown no interest in taking up the bill. It did, however, garner some small measure of bipartisan support — although Trump has thrown the weight of the White House against the bill, it did receive two House Republican votes in December.\n",
            "Instead, Trump has aligned himself more with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has advanced a narrower set of reforms from his perch as the Senate Finance Committee chair. (Grassley has also accused McConnell of sabotaging his bill, which moved out of Grassley’s committee with bipartisan support.)\n",
            "His committee sent a bill to the full Senate in the fall, though it has languished there in the months since. It’s unclear if Trump’s quasi-endorsement — he did not call out Grassley’s bill directly Tuesday night, instead praising the senator generally for his individual work on the issue — will provide any new momentum for the plan. Grassley’s bill, as the Brookings Institution documented, achieves pricing reform through a mix of technical changes to the rebates that drug makers pay under Medicare and Medicaid as well as provisions to cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors.\n",
            "Right now, neither of the bills seems on a fast track to anywhere. Part of this is because Trump’s interest in drug pricing has been scattershot at best, and many Republicans are reluctant to place too many new regulations on an innovation industry.\n",
            "But, the president clearly knows health care is a vulnerability for him, which is why he devoted a few minutes to the topic at his State of the Union. Recent polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed just 30 percent of Americans approved of his work on the issue. But with his administration firmly against the House Democratic bill, and no sign of movement in the Republican Senate, Trump’s rhetoric on Tuesday might end up being empty.\n",

My great-great-uncle — my grandmother’s uncle — was Barney Pressman, the Lower East Side haberdasher who founded the legendary New York department store, Barneys. My great-great-uncle opened his eponymous men’s clothing store in 1923 at 7th Avenue and 17th Street in Chelsea, and over the next decades of the 20th century it would evolve into a worldwide fashion destination.\n",
            "Barneys was a particular kind of rags-to-riches success story, one that I’ll call the Jewish American Dream. You start out selling schmattas (Yiddish for rags) and end up the scion of an elite family business that over three generations becomes a cultural institution that even WASPs admire enviously. That the company is now bankrupt and being liquidated by a blur of corporations and hedge funds and financial firms only makes the rise before Barneys’ downfall all the more remarkable.\n",
            "Even as I watched the company flounder from afar, Barneys always stood for the kind of glamour I coveted but could never attain. In its heyday, Barneys was, according to New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman, “unabashedly elitist, proudly exclusionary — you got it or you didn’t, and if you didn’t, that was your problem, not theirs — and imbued with an arrogance that, at a certain point, began to chafe.” Who shopped at Barneys? All of the important fashionistas, including the ones on TV: the ladies of Sex and the City, the ladies of Gossip Girl, the cast of Mad Men.\n",
            "That’s how I wanted to be! That relatives of mine could be such utter snobs is a triumph I could only dream of emulating. Like a Jewish Pygmalion, Barneys had lost its Yiddishisms and grown into an elegant, cultural force. Which is why watching Barneys disappear from the public eye feels like an enormous loss even though I could never, not even once, afford to shop there myself.\n",
            "Early in his career, my great-great-uncle was known as the “Cut-Rate Clothing King,” which is yet another way I know that paying full retail price isn’t in my DNA. Barneys initially made its fortune by selling brand-name men’s clothing at heavily discounted prices and focusing on innovative advertising, like a “Calling All Men to Barneys” spot in the style of the Dick Tracy radio show. Legend has it that Barney pawned his wife’s wedding ring in order to open the store in Chelsea. The store’s motto at the time was a pure tribute to his Lower East Side roots: “No bunk, no junk, no imitations.”\n",
            "My great-grandfather, Samuel Pressman, was Barney’s brother. When Barney opened the store on 17th Street, Samuel worked there too. Samuel’s Hebrew name was Tomkin Schmuel, so at the store everyone called him Tommy. My mother grew up going from her home in Jersey City to Chelsea to call on her grandfather whenever a man in the family needed a suit. She remembers that, as a child, the store seemed much less intimidating than uptown department stores like Saks.\n",
            "“When I walked into that store,” she told me, “I had an enormous sense of pride that family started a big business in New York, with my great-uncle’s name in big bold letters above the door. I was treated like a little princess by my relatives who worked there and their associates.”\n",
            "In the 1960s, Barney’s son Fred started to take the store in an entirely new, decidedly more upscale direction. Fred is credited with bringing Giorgio Armani’s tailoring to Americans in the 1970s. He also initiated the opening of a women’s store at Barneys, which his son, Gene, is credited with building into a nexus for luxury and unique fashions. The store where my mom had played with the three-way mirrors in the free alterations area was changing quickly.\n",
            "By the time I started to visit the store in the 1980s, Barneys wasn’t just lavish in a Wall Street “greed is good” kind of way; it was also cool. In 1986, the same year my whole family made the trip into Manhattan to find bar mitzvah suits for my older brothers, Simon Doonan was hired as the window dresser at Barneys, beginning his career of making eccentric, over-the-top creations that made pedestrians stop and gawk.\n",
            "1986 was also when upstart models Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista were featured in Barneys ads, and that November the store hosted Decorated Denim, an auction in which Barneys had artists modify Levi’s denim jackets and sold them to benefit AIDS research. Models included Madonna and Iman wearing denim that had been embellished by Paloma Picasso, Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Andy Warhol (Warhol had also modeled for print ads for the store in 1982). If retail stores had IQs, then Barneys was a certified genius.\n",
            "I have no memories of such lavishness at the store in the 1980s, although 7-year-old me is still mad that she missed Madonna. Barneys may have become a destination of clothing that functioned as art, but for the most part it had nothing to hold the interest of a little girl from suburban New Jersey. We still primarily used Barneys as a place to buy men’s suits. At the time, we had a 15-percent-off family discount. That got us just about nowhere back then, and it was fine when the family discount expired, because 15 percent off of increasingly unaffordable clothes is still unaffordable.\n",
            "I want to tell you about how I remember Barneys in its early glory days, all avant-garde charm and quirky excess, but my strongest memory of going with my family as a child had nothing to do with the store: It was the grilled cheese I’d get at the diner next door, whose name has been lost to time. Later, I would read about power lunches that big shots had at Freds, the restaurant named after Barney’s son, and I’m sure the salade Nicoise is great but nothing was better than that diner grilled cheese.\n",
            "The store continued to grow in cultural cachet in the 1990s. Barney’s grandchildren, my very distant cousins I admire but have never met, were running the store at the time and adding their own personal touches. In a November 2019 article in Vogue, Steff Yotka writes, “More than just a place to discover Rick Owens leather jackets and Proenza Schouler bustiers, Barneys acted as a connective tissue in the New York creative scene. It was where in-the-know people went to shop ... more upscale, whimsical, and international.” The store carried unique products that patrons came from all over the world to purchase, with exclusive deals with designers from Christian Louboutin and Azzedine Alaïa to Proenza Schouler, a brand I have only ever shopped when it made a special line for Target.\n",
            "We had mostly stopped going to the store by the 1990s, when Barneys began to expand throughout the country and internationally. In 1993, Gene and Bob Pressman (Barney’s grandchildren) spent approximately $185 million on a new flagship store on Madison Avenue and 61st Street, and just a few years later the store in Chelsea closed. Meanwhile, the enormous expansion (new stores opened everywhere from Houston to Tokyo) weighed on the finances of the privately held company, and the family lost control of Barneys after its first bankruptcy filing in 1996. They sold their remaining interest in the company in 2004 even as the uptown location continued to thrive.\n",
            "In 2007, I moved to a 500-square-foot studio apartment in Chelsea not too far from the old Barneys store. The space had become a Loehmann’s, a luxury discount store that suited my needs perfectly. I would spend hours in bad lighting picking through racks for $40 dresses the same way I imagined other, more elegant women would rummage through cardboard boxes at Barneys’ famous warehouse sale to find $800 designer sweaters discounted to $500. I would try on my findings in the shabby Loehmann’s communal dressing rooms, where women of all shapes and sizes and backgrounds competed for mirror space, and I would delight in getting a Loehmann’s receipt that would show me exactly how much money I’d saved off the retail price. By the time Barneys returned to its old Chelsea space for a short run starting in 2016, I was too busy mourning the loss of Loehmann’s to be excited about the homecoming.\n",
            "As the years went on, Barneys lost some of its charm. Its ownership had changed hands several times from retail corporations to hedge funds, which watered down its identity. According to the New York Times, a 2010 renovation made Barneys look more like its rivals, “as fish tanks and mosaics were swapped out for generic marble.” Gross! In August 2019, Barneys filed for bankruptcy for the second time and was sold off for parts. The financial firm B. Riley Financial held a liquidation sale at Barneys at the end of that year, and what remains of the store is a motley collection of leftovers and EVERYTHING MUST GO signs. As recently as January 16, the New York Times reported that since November, “employees at Barneys’s flagship at Madison Avenue have been in limbo, lacking basic information about the store’s closing date, severance pay and their benefits.” The welfare of the salesforce that used to be revered for its personalization and panache is now seemingly an afterthought.\n",
            "I’m in my 40s and freelancing, and that magical shopping switch never flipped for me. I buy on consignment; I won’t even look at a piece of Banana Republic clothing unless it’s at least 40 percent off. Now, during the liquidation process, the Barneys brand has been licensed to Saks, and so I took a quick look on the Barneys at Saks website to see how the family legacy would continue on: Balenciaga dad sneakers for $995, a Prada gym bag for $1,520, and a Saint Laurent varsity jacket for $2,550. Alas, my Jewish American Dream is more modest: to live in a city where workers get paid, where mom-and-pop stores stick around, and where you can feel like a million bucks even if your wardrobe comes from the Nordstrom Rack.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21123904/spotify-bill-simmons-ringer-deal\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "Spotify is making yet another big-budget purchase aimed at getting a lead in the growing podcast industry: The streaming music company has agreed to a deal to purchase The Ringer, the podcast-centric media company run and owned by Bill Simmons.\n",
            "Spotify intends to hire Simmons and all of his approximately 90 employees. Most of those employees work on The Ringer’s website, which covers sports and culture, and Spotify intends to keep the site up and running.\n",
            "But what Spotify really wants out of the deal is Simmons’s ability to create podcasts, including his Bill Simmons Podcast, and some 30 other titles, which range from an NBA chat show to one devoted to rewatching old movies.\n",
            "The companies didn’t disclose a sale price; the deal is supposed to close in the first quarter of 2020.\n",
            "“With the Ringer, we’re basically getting the new ESPN,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Recode in an interview after the deal was announced. “What [Simmons] has accomplished in just a few short years, it’s nothing short of extraordinary. ... It’s not just his own podcast, but his whole network that’s doing really well. He’s a talent magnet.”\n",
            "Spotify hasn’t spelled out what it intends to do with The Ringer’s catalog of existing podcasts and content, but it would be surprising if it made them exclusive to the streaming platform. When it purchased Gimlet Media last year, it kept that podcast company’s stuff available on all platforms.\n",
            "Here’s Simmons’s only commentary so far:\n",
            "This morning we announced that @spotify is acquiring The Ringer. Couldn’t be more excited to work with @eldsjal and his phenomenal team.More details to come down the road... but @ringer will remain @ringer in every respect. They appreciate what we do and they want us to be us.\n",
            "This is the fourth podcast company acquisition Spotify has made in the last 12 months; last year it spent about $400 million to buy Gimlet Media, Anchor FM, and Parcast. Spotify executives have argued that adding a podcast business to its core music service will help them bring in new users, and keep existing users around longer.\n",
            "The company is also building up a podcast advertising business, which promises to target listeners based on their demographics and online behavior. In its fourth quarter earnings statement released Wednesday morning, Spotify said it was seeing “exponential growth” in podcast consumption on its platform.\n",
            "Ek said adding The Ringer would help boost his company’s appeal to sports fans, which he described as “super engaged and super loyal. It’s a strong currency to have.” And he said Spotify would continue to buy podcasting companies if it thinks they can grow faster inside of Spotify. “When you get a chance for a property like The Ringer, and you see the fits, and what Bill wants to do, it just made a ton of sense. If there are other deals of that caliber we would consider it.”\n",
            "Spotify wouldn’t say how long Simmons intended to work for his new employer, but Ek said he believed Simmons would stick around so he could continue to build the company he founded five years ago. “I wouldn’t have done the deal if I didn’t feel that Bill was in it for the right reasons, and didn’t want to build something much bigger.”\n",
            "“Our incentives are really aligned,” added Paul Vogel, Spotify’s chief financial officer.\n",
            "Podcasting is growing fast, but it is still a niche business compared to the rest of the ad world. Last year, Edison Research estimated that 32 percent of people in the US over age 12 — that’s 90 million people — listened to a podcast each month. That’s up from 11 percent a decade ago.\n",
            "But advertisers usually take a while to follow users. Podcasting advertising is supposed to generate more than $860 million this year and $1 billion in 2021. But the rest of digital advertising brings in more than $107 billion in the US.\n",
            "Until now, Apple has dominated podcasting, primarily because of the popularity of its iOS operating system, which features a built-in podcasting app. But Apple hasn’t tried to make money from podcasts itself, and it doesn’t take a cut of the advertisements that listeners hear when they play podcasts on Apple’s devices and apps.\n",
            "While Apple has expressed interest in funding some exclusive podcasts that would serve as marketing for its Apple TV+ service, Apple executives say the company is unlikely to compete in today’s version of the podcast industry. That’s because most podcasts are free and dependent on advertising, and Apple has staked out a pro-privacy position that makes it difficult to compete in ad-supported industries.\n",
            "Simmons made his name as an online columnist at Disney-owned ESPN, which eventually gave him the resources to launch Grantland, a Ringer-like site that also provided a home for his podcasts. But ESPN bounced him out of his job in 2015 — a move Simmons has said stems from his criticism of Roger Goodell, the head of the National Football League and an important Disney partner.\n",
            "Simmons then started The Ringer with backing from WarnerMedia’s HBO, which also hired him to create a short-lived TV show he hosted, along with other programming. Simmons has never disclosed if he has other investors; a person familiar with HBO’s initial investment says the company put in less than $10 million. Last year, Simmons talked to WarnerMedia’s Turner unit about selling his company to that business, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n",
            "By buying The Ringer, Spotify is now in the web publishing business for the first time. (Vox Media, which owns Recode, has a commercial relationship with The Ringer.) While podcasts have driven The Ringer’s business, Ek said the site’s writers and videomakers were an important part of the company. “What’s really interesting with the website and the audio is that he’s really tried to play them off of each other.”\n",
            "The Spotify/Ringer deal comes a week after Barstool Sports, another sports and pop culture publisher, was acquired by casino operator Penn National Gaming in a deal that values Barstool at $450 million. Like The Ringer, Barstool also has a significant podcast business, which it says generates around $30 million a year; Penn National intends to use Barstool’s name and appeal to rebrand several of its casinos and to launch an online sports betting business.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21123628/trump-white-history-lesson-sotu\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "As Trump closed out his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he made sure to nod to his largest, and most devout, voter base — white people.\n",
            "“This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley,” he noted. “This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.”\n",
            "He completely forgot to mention that before Earp, Crockett, Oakley, and the Pilgrims ever arrived on what we now know as America, there were Indigenous people, those who had been living on and caring for the land for thousands of years.\n",
            "“The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth,” Trump continued. “Our ancestors braved the unknown, tamed the wilderness, settled the Wild West.”\n",
            "In his retelling of history, the president not only erased the millions of Native peoples prior to Columbus’s arrival in 1492, but suggested that their lands, livelihoods, and existence were something to be tamed and conquered. “Our ancestors,” as Trump referred to, were these settlers — white people from England and Europe. More recent immigrants were denigrated as “wicked human traffickers” and “illegals” in other parts of Trump’s speech. The nearly 40 percent of Americans who are not white apparently did not bear mentioning in Trump’s history.\n",
            "In his revisionist telling of the “founding” of America, Trump also completely erased slavery. According to Trump, after taming the Wild West, and “lifting millions from poverty, disease, and hunger” (Indigenous people not among them), these ancestors also “laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers — and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history.”\n",
            "Many historians would argue that it was not the white colonists who built the foundations of this country, but those they had enslaved. The White House, the Capitol, Wall Street, and many of our Ivy League universities were built with enslaved labor. America became a global economy because of enslaved labor. It is an ugly history, but an undeniable one: The bodies of the enslaved — abused and routinely murdered — helped colonists build the country we know today.\n",
            "Trump is notorious for these sorts of dog whistles — and more overt displays of racism. While campaigning in 2016, he retweeted white supremacists, called Mexicans “rapists,” and told black voters they lived in “poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs.” As president, he has condemned people from “shithole countries,” and after the Charlottesville rally in 2017, said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that ensued. Tuesday night, he awarded Rush Limbaugh — a man who has consistently made racist comments against black people — with the country’s highest civilian honor.\n",
            "While the history portion of Trump’s speech might have been more subtly racist than messaging he has invoked in the past, it was still intended to show whose history matters.\n",
            "“We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God,” Trump said as he ended his speech.\n",
            "The “we,” of course, are the people he hopes will carry him to reelection: The 62 percent of white men and 52 percent of white women who voted for him the last time around.\n",

            "On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump gave it to one of America’s most prominent racists.\n",
            "During his State of the Union address, Trump looked to Rush Limbaugh, seated in the audience with Melania Trump, and thanked him for his contributions to American life.\n",
            "“And Rush, in recognition of all you have done for our nation, the millions of people today that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight he will be receiving our country’s highest — you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom.”\n",
            "Republicans cheered.\n",
            "John F. Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 to honor Americans who have made “an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”\n",
            "Limbaugh, recently diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer, has devoted his decades-long radio career to building an audience of millions of listeners with his brand of right-wing, xenophobic — and patently racist — populism that Trump borrowed on his rise to power.\n",
            "Limbaugh fills hours of airtime each week with hateful commentary directed at African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with disabilities, and pretty much anyone who is not white, straight, and male.\n",
            "One person he does like: Donald Trump. Limbaugh has supported Trump since he won the 2016 nomination and has largely stood by him. He’s had him on his show for softball interviews more than once.\n",
            "Limbaugh, like Trump, was a longtime birther. Trump was an early birther adopter and kept spreading the conspiracy nine months into his presidency.\n",
            "Limbaugh’s racist rants continued beyond the 2008 election and started long before.\n",
            "The list of examples goes on and on.\n",
            "Trump has made his own racist remarks and relied on race baiting throughout his career. From his entry into the presidential race — calling Mexicans “rapists” — to his many, many comments since about various groups, his presidency has been defined by racial animus. “I think they’re trouble. I think they’re looking for trouble,” Trump said of Black Lives Matters activists in a Fox News interview with Bill O’Reilly, echoing Limbaugh’s view.\n",
            "It’s worth noting that beyond race, both men hold deeply held sexist views, too. Limbaugh once attacked a law student and health care advocate, Sandra Fluke, who was fighting to require health insurance providers to cover birth control, by calling her a slut:\n",
            "What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke [sic], who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She’s having so much sex she can’t afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.\n",
            "Trump has confronted women in public life similarly, as he did in describing then-Fox anchor Megyn Kelly as having “blood coming out of her wherever” or dismissing Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser Christine Blasey Ford because “it doesn’t matter. We won.”\n",
            "Both men recently made sexist, ableist attacks on teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has autism.\n",
            "“So she’s out tweeting and politicizing, and she is free to lie and say whatever she wants to say about climate change and who’s responsible for it,” Limbaugh said. “And nobody is permitted to question her, you see, because she has — what did they call it? She is in the autism spectrum, so you can’t disagree, you can’t question, because she’s not well.”\n",
            "Both men have become powerful through building up a base by putting down others. Now one is honoring the other. And there’s nothing meritorious about it.\n",

            "If President Donald Trump gave a preview of his reelection message Tuesday night, Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar’s official Spanish-language response was the first look at the message the Democratic Party wants Latino voters to hear.\n",
            "Escobar, a first-term member of Congress who won the seat previously held by former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, became one of the first Latinas to represent Texas in Congress when she was elected in November 2018.\n",
            "In her response, Escobar outlined the Democrats’ stance on bread-and-butter election issues, including universal affordable health care and raising the federal minimum wage. It showed how the Democrats are trying to frame the issues voters care about most in terms that appeal to Latinos, without predominantly focusing on the immigration debate.\n",
            "But Escobar also made specific appeals to her primarily Latino audience, including how the president’s rhetoric has targeted Latinos and immigrants more broadly.\n",
            "“In America, our diversity makes us stronger — it is what uplifts all voices and makes us an inclusive, dynamic country,” she said in Spanish. “Yet, the president clearly does not share this belief.”\n",
            "Speaking at a community center in her district of El Paso, she acknowledged Puerto Ricans’ struggle to rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. And she pointed out how Trump’s immigration policies have harmed immigrants living in the US, including so-called DREAMers, who may lose their legal status if the president’s efforts to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals prevails; immigrant families who were separated on the border; migrant children who have died in immigration custody; and migrants who face dangerous conditions waiting in Mexico for their chance to seek asylum in the US.\n",
            "“These are policies none of us ever imagined would happen in America in our lifetime,” she said.\n",
            "Escobar has already been a vocal critic of Trump’s immigration rhetoric and policies sending asylum seekers back to Mexico, arguing that they have stoked the kind of hate that led to last year’s shooting in El Paso, in which 22 people died.\n",
            "She invoked the same argument in her rebuttal, calling for legislation to ameliorate the gun violence epidemic and reiterated that the El Paso shooter used the “same hateful words” that Trump uses when referring to immigrants.\n",
            "The Spanish-language rebuttal, which has been delivered by both Democrats and Republicans over the years, is a relatively new tradition that started in 2011 in an effort to reach out to the 37 million Latinos living in the US who speak Spanish at home. While Spanish is the US’s most common non-English language, the share of Latinos who speak Spanish is actually decreasing, in part because many Latinos living in the US are US-born.\n",
            "Latino outreach will be important for 2020 Democrats in states like Florida, which Trump won by a razor-thin margin in 2016 and where Latinos make up nearly a quarter of the population.\n",

            "During his speech, Trump railed against “criminal illegal immigrants,” promised to protect health care for people with preexisting conditions (when in fact his administration has fought to get rid of such protections), and heaped praise on conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh (who has a decades-long history of sexist and racist statements).\n",
            "At least two Democrats were so disgusted with the speech that they walked out. Several others, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, chose to boycott it.\n",

            "The moment had echoes of a previous Pelosi move — at the 2019 State of the Union, her smirking applause for the president became a meme, with many assuming it was sarcastic. She insisted it was genuine, but Pelosi has always had a flair for imagery.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "During his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Trump didn’t breathe a word about climate change, the most serious threat to our security, health, economy, and natural world.\n",
            "He did, however, mention his surprising new support for trees.\n",
            "“To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world,” Trump said.\n",
            "Last month, Trump announced that the US would join the program at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “We will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing and better managing our trees and our forests,” Trump said at the event, but didn’t add any details about what the US would do to participate.\n",
            "The trillion tree program is also the newfound passion of Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce; at Davos, he launched a platform to manage it, called 1T.org. The company has also pledged to “support and mobilize the conservation and restoration of 100 million trees over the next decade.”\n",
            "The idea is that tree planting is a nature-based solution to climate change, since trees and soil can take in and store the heat-trapping carbon from the atmosphere that is warming the planet. Recently, there’s been a big surge in interest in this approach, especially since a controversial study in 2019 found that fully restoring degraded forests around the world would undo a large share of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
            "This idea seems to have struck a chord with some Republicans lately. Last year, Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AK), wrote an editorial calling for preserving forests by creating markets for sustainable forest products like wood pellet biofuels and timber construction materials. This week, Westerman is expected to unveil a bill that would commit the US to planting 3.3 billion trees a year for the next 30 years.\n",
            "“The pragmatic, proactive thing to do is to plant forests and manage them so that you’re actually pulling carbon out of the atmosphere,” Westerman told the Hill.\n",
            "The most advanced carbon capture tool we have is growing right in our backyards. I'm excited to aid POTUS in putting this plan into action.   https://t.co/mfxTqbKUyG\n",
            "Westerman has a degree in forestry, so his interest in reforestation makes sense. Trump, however, has flaunted his disdain for all things pertaining to climate change. He has rolled back regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and attacked climate activists. He has also proposed opening up the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, North America’s largest intact temperate rainforest, to logging. The think tank Center for American Progress called it America’s largest natural carbon sink.\n",
            "“The same man who is proposing to cut down the Tongass National Forest wants to plant a trillion trees,” said Ryan Richards, a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, in a statement. “He can’t have it both ways. We need a comprehensive climate plan that gets us to 100 percent clean future.”\n",
            "Greenpeace was similarly skeptical about Trump’s commitment. “In the face of a climate emergency, Trump’s ‘trillion trees’ initiative is like trying to put out a raging dumpster fire with a squirt gun,” said Janet Redman, climate campaign director for Greenpeace USA. “Planting trees is not a substitute for cutting carbon emissions or addressing the unjust impacts of extractive industries on marginalized communities.”\n",
            "Tree planting, like Republicans’ push for innovation as a solution to climate change, is an approach that doesn’t challenge pro fossil-fuel orthodoxies. It elides the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, curb fossil fuel consumption, work with other countries, or to increase energy efficiency. Instead, it distills the solution to climate change into a seemingly simple move. So for Trump, committing to planting trees is an easy way to claim he’s doing something for the environment with little political risk.\n",
            "In the year 2020, how can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?\n",
            "However, reforestation is not a simple fix for climate change, or any other environmental issue. Forests are diverse ecosystems and their ability to store carbon depends not just on trees, but a delicate balance of rainfall, soil nutrients, fungi, animals, and plants working together. A successful tree-planting program has to include all of these elements, adding cost and complexity, and it’s not clear how 1t.org will address this.\n",
            "And forest restoration requires ongoing active management, support, and buy-in on the ground from communities that live in and around forests, particularly indigenous groups  that count on healthy forests for their survival. Simply planting scores of oaks, maples, kapoks, and cedars will not solve climate change and won’t guarantee that a forest will survive.\n",
            "Planting trees also in no way reduces the need to curb greenhouse gases to emissions if the goal is to limit climate change this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius, the target set out under the Paris climate agreement, an agreement that Trump is also backing out of later this year. But with all of Trump’s rollbacks of environmental protections, joining the drive to plant a trillion trees stands to be one of his most significant actions to help the planet.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer probably made a smart choice by trying to give an earnest policy speech in her response to the State of the Union address, rather than one addressing the president’s crimes or the blood-soaked demagoguery of the anti-immigrant rhetoric in Trump’s speech Tuesday night.\n",
            "The problem is that it was also a boring speech.\n",
            "The logic behind Whitmer’s approach is the great paradox of the Trump era. Over the past couple of months, when Trump’s been mired in scandal and impeached in Congress, his approval ratings have actually been relatively strong his low point came in the fall and winter of 2017, when political media was mostly focused on Republican legislation on health care and taxes.\n",
            "All of Trump’s antics and scandals don’t exactly help him politically. His approval rating at this point in his presidency is lower than what Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, or Ronald Reagan enjoyed. But it’s policy issues that seem to have the power to really sink him.\n",
            "Those issues are what Whitmer focused on in her speech, observing that congressional Democrats aren’t just investigating Trump. They’re passing bills.\n",
            "“Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats passed a landmark bill on equal pay,” she said, “another bill to give 30 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage, and groundbreaking legislation to finally give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices for America’s seniors and families.”\n",
            "WATCH: Democratic Response from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer https://t.co/olAq2fUNpg #SOTU #SOTU2020\n",
            "This is all true. She shouted out state-level initiatives, including overtime pay rights in Pennsylvania and Michigan, teacher pay increases in Nevada and North Carolina, all-day kindergarten in Colorado, and a school funding hike in Wisconsin, that show what Democrats can do when they’re allowed to govern.\n",
            "And she observed, accurately, that despite the squabbling in the Democratic presidential primary, all the candidates’ health plans are directionally the same — offering Americans better, more robustly subsidized coverage — while Trump is suing to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\n",
            "In theory, this is absolutely the right message for Democrats: They are going to help you and your family in tangible ways rather than get sucked into a culture war food fight with Trump.\n",
            "The problem is the speech was so boring that I was tempted not to write about it at all. But as someone who strongly believes that treating Trump as a more-or-less “normal” Republican politician is the best way to beat him, I have an obligation not to just tune Democrats out when they try.\n",
            "That, though, is easier said than done. Trump has such a larger-than-life personality and is so skilled at pushing people’s buttons that following a speech full of reality show antics (a live medal presentation to Rush Limbaugh!) with an earnest discussion of why his paid family leave plan is grossly inadequate compared to Democrats’ plans for leave and a child allowance ends up seeming gray and sad.\n",
            "I generally believe that moderates do better in elections, but this is one reason the “electability” calculus in 2020 is a bit more complicated. Most Democrats just loathe Trump and everything he stands for on an instinctual level. There’s a reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped his speech up.\n",
            "But the Electoral College margin is going to be won and lost on the backs of voters who don’t feel that way about Trump, but who might disagree with him nonetheless about health care, the minimum wage, or the right to an abortion. (A lot of people are under the impression that swing voters are dead and modern elections are all won through mobilization these days, but it’s not true.)\n",
            "The challenge for Democrats this fall is to find a better way to execute on Whitmer’s basic plan: talk about real stuff, not the Trump Show, but make it interesting enough that people will want to watch, quote, and share what they have to say.\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/4/21115084/trump-wall-border-immigrants-sotu-state-union\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "President Donald Trump has spent three years molding America’s immigration system to primarily be concerned with keeping people out.\n",
            "He built, layer by layer, impediments in Central America, at the border, in detention centers, and in the immigration courts that have made obtaining asylum nearly impossible.\n",
            "He swept aside former President Barack Obama’s immigration enforcement priorities in favor of vastly expanding immigration detention and prosecuting every immigrant who crosses the border without authorization. The result is a punitive system that treats immigrants as criminals and places them in prolonged detention even if they don’t pose any danger to the public.\n",
            "And he waged a quiet and effective campaign to reduce legal immigration — including expanding his travel ban to block immigration from Nigeria, the largest country in Africa. Under Trump, the legal immigration system increasingly rewards skills and wealth over family ties to the US, while shutting out a growing number of people from low-income countries.\n",
            "When Trump laid out the start of his reelection-year argument in the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, his guests included a senior Border Patrol official and the brother of a man who was killed by an unauthorized immigrant. His immigration record was one of his top talking points.\n",
            "He painted immigrants as criminals that pose a danger to public safety (overall, they don’t) and railed against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities. And he touted his policies clamping down on unauthorized border crossers.\n",
            "“Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again,” Trump said. “My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed.”\n",
            "It’s true that Trump has run into some roadblocks: He’s behind schedule on construction of the southern border wall, a key messaging tool for his base. He hasn’t been able to appoint his preferred candidates to lead the immigration agencies. His attempts to pass immigration-related legislation in Congress have failed. And his policies have faced so much opposition in the courts that his administration has appeared to pursue a strategy of rapidly churning out new policies and hoping that at least some of them survive judicial review.\n",
            "But while he might not have succeeded at building an actual wall to keep immigrants out, his policies have achieved the same end. Reducing overall immigration levels has long been on the wish list of once-fringe restrictionist groups like the Center for Immigration Studies, whose co-founder advocated for maintaining a European-American majority population. Trump is making it a reality.\n",
            "Trump’s primary focus upon entering office was addressing the unprecedented number of children and families arriving at the southern border from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala — collectively known as Central America’s Northern Triangle — where crime, violence, and lack of economic opportunity has driven hundreds of thousands to flee over the past two years.\n",
            "The administration hasn’t addressed the root causes of that crisis, but it has effectively cut off migrants’ access to the US asylum system. His ability to do all this has even surprised Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n",
            "“I didn’t expect them to pull it off,” he said. (Krikorian and his group are still pushing Trump to go further in his second term; his strategies have “taken the edge off,” but migrants are still continuing to arrive in “unacceptably high” numbers, he argues.)\n",
            "Trump has deputized Central American countries in his immigration enforcement efforts. Some 60,000 asylum seekers have been sent back to Mexico to wait for their immigration court hearings in the US under his “remain in Mexico” policy, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). It has appeared to discourage migrants from attempting to cross the southern border but has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Mexico, where thousands are waiting for their court hearings in the US, many of them in dire need of humanitarian aid.\n",
            "Some migrants are lucky to find housing in shelters, hotels, or rooms for rent, but for more than 5,000 others, only tents and tarps, some held up by only sticks and stones, stand between them and the elements, even as temperatures drop below freezing. As populations swell, both the US and Mexico have left thousands in the camps without basic necessities like clean drinking water and warm clothes — and at risk of extortion, kidnapping, and rape at the hands of cartels and other criminal actors.\n",
            "Trump has also brokered a series of agreements with the Northern Triangle countries that require migrants to apply for protections in those countries first. If they fail to do so, US immigration authorities can send them back to those countries (though only the agreement with Guatemala is currently in effect). So far, 368 asylum seekers have been deported to Guatemala.\n",
            "The agreements resemble “safe third-country agreements,” a rarely used diplomatic tool that requires migrants to seek asylum in the countries they pass through by deeming those countries capable of offering them protection (though the Trump administration has been reluctant to use that term). Until recently, the US had this kind of agreement with just one country: Canada.\n",
            "These agreements were never meant to be a means to push the burden of absorbing asylum seekers onto other countries, but that appears to be the way Trump is trying to use them. Immigrant advocates say the costs could be deadly, since it means returning migrants to countries that have high levels of crime and instability, and that are not used to dealing with an influx of people seeking refuge.\n",
            "In Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, migrants are commonly robbed, kidnapped for ransom, raped, tortured, and killed. The State Department, meanwhile, has issued travel warnings for US citizens in all four countries.\n",
            "El Salvador has the highest homicide rate in the world, while Honduras ranks fifth, Guatemala 16th, and Mexico 19th, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. They have rampant government corruption and high rates of violence against women and LGBTQ individuals.\n",
            "As much as Trump’s rhetoric focuses on clamping down on unauthorized immigration at the southern border, the president has also instituted new restrictions on legal immigration — many of which have survived Supreme Court review.\n",
            "During his speech on Tuesday, Trump called for an immigration system that rewards immigrants who “contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values” — while keeping out low-income immigrants and nonwhites from what he once referred to as “shithole countries.” He’s already bringing that vision to life.\n",
            "Heeding calls from 31 states to end refugee admissions from Syria, Trump has slashed the total number of refugees the US accepts annually to just 18,000 this year, the fewest in history and down from a cap of 110,000 just two years ago.\n",
            "His so-called public charge rule essentially establishes a wealth test for immigrants seeking to enter the US, extend their visa, or convert their temporary immigration status into a green card. The rule gives immigration officials much more leeway to turn away those who are “likely to be a public charge” based on an evaluation of 20 factors, ranging from the use of certain public benefits programs — including food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers, and Medicaid — to English language proficiency.\n",
            "Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said that 69 percent of the roughly 5.5 million people who were granted green cards over the past five years had at least one negative factor under the rule, which officials could have used as justification to reject their applications for immigration benefits.\n",
            "Trump is also cracking down on foreigners giving birth to children in the US who become, by birth, American citizens, particularly if they can’t prove they can pay for their medical treatment.\n",
            "And he’s placed restrictions on citizens of many Muslim-majority and African countries. His travel ban prevents citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and North Korea from obtaining any kind of visa allowing them to enter the US. He recently added new restrictions on immigration from six additional countries — Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania — in what advocates are calling an “African ban” since about four in five of those affected are from African nations.\n",
            "Trump has overcome court challenges to some of these policies: In four of the six cases in which the Supreme Court weighed in on Trump’s immigration policies, the court’s conservative majority has so far sided with the administration. Notably, the justices upheld his travel ban in June 2018, affirming his broad powers to restrict immigration to the US for national security reasons.\n",
            "The justices have also allowed Trump to move forward with his immigration policy plans while lawsuits challenging them make their way through lower courts.\n",
            "They gave the green light to Trump’s rule preventing migrants from applying for asylum if they passed through another country other than their own before arriving in the US. They also allowed him to divert $3.6 billion in military funds to construct the border wall and implement the public charge rule.\n",
            "The way Trump talks about immigration in his State of the Union address is likely to preview what he says on the campaign trail.\n",
            "That might appeal to the 42 percent of voters who support his immigration policies. But 57 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s performance on immigration and 60 percent either oppose or strongly oppose the construction of the border wall, his signature immigration policy.\n",
            "Not only are most voters against Trump’s immigration policies, but many also just don’t view it as a top priority — bread-and-butter issues like health care and the economy are what they care about most. Fifty-one percent of voters overall said that immigration should be a top priority, ranking below eight other policy issues. Republicans seem to care more about immigration, with 68 percent saying it should be a top priority compared to 40 percent of Democrats.\n",
            "The share of Americans who support increasing immigration has also risen to 32 percent as of 2018, up from 10 percent in 2001.\n",
            "“While Trump mobilizes his core supporters on the issue of immigration, he also mobilizes a backlash to his divisiveness and xenophobia,” Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, said.\n",
            "Democratic candidates have largely ignored the topic of immigration in the debates so far, but based on the immigration plans they’ve released, the entire field has moved to the left on immigration. All of the frontrunners would, for example, push for a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants living in the US and streamline the process of applying for asylum and other forms of legal immigration.\n",
            "Their biggest challenge upon entering office, however, would be reversing Trump’s changes to the immigration system. Much of it they could accomplish unilaterally by executive action — they could end MPP and the travel ban and raise the cap on refugee admissions immediately, for example — but some of Trump’s changes are harder to reverse.\n",
            "Repealing Trump-era immigration regulations would involve a protracted process of giving public notice and the opportunity to comment that often takes months. It may also take time to rebuild some of the institutions that deal with immigration. For example, Trump has presided over a brain drain of experienced staffers in the immigration courts and the State Department, which manages the refugee program and consulates abroad.\n",
            "For as much as Democratic candidates claim they will reverse Trump’s policies, the president has left his mark on the immigration system. He has delivered for his base on that front — and he’s hoping it will be enough to carry him to victory again in 2020.\n",

            "Fred Guttenberg, the father of a teen girl killed in the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school shooting, was escorted out of the State of the Union on Tuesday after protesting President Donald Trump’s inaction on gun violence.\n",
            "Guttenberg’s protest came shortly after Trump vowed his opposition to stricter gun laws. “Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country,” Trump said. “So long as I am president I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”\n",
            "Guttenberg reportedly shouted that his daughter was a victim of gun violence, before Capitol Police went to him and escorted him out. According to NBC News reporter Kasie Hunt, many Democrats on the floor applauded Guttenberg as he was taken away. Most of the situation was drowned out on air as Republicans applauded Trump’s remarks.\n",
            "Guttenberg previously received some national media attention for confronting Brett Kavanaugh, then a nominee for the Supreme Court, over his record on gun violence.\n",
            "Guttenberg attended the State of the Union after receiving an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has pushed gun control bills, including a universal background check measure, through the House. He wore an orange tie, symbolizing gun violence awareness.\n",

After the shooting, Guttenberg became vocal advocate for stricter gun laws, taking part in the movement that transformed into #NeverAgain and March for Our Lives. That movement culminated in a massive march in Washington, DC, but it has also continued to inspire voter turnout efforts and candidates running largely on doing something about gun violence.\n",
            "While the movement, as well as growing attention to mass shootings in the US, has led some states to enact stricter gun laws, Trump and Republicans in Congress have so far rejected such efforts.

            "“I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families,” Trump claimed. “We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.”\n",
            "The bad news for people with preexisting conditions is that this “ironclad pledge” is a lie. Trump and his administration have fought hard — in all three branches of government — to strip people with preexisting health conditions of the protections they enjoy under the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, if Trump has his way, those protections will cease to exist.\n",
            "Obamacare provides that insurers in the individual health insurance market must cover people with preexisting conditions, and it forbids those insurers from charging higher premiums to people with such conditions — a practice known as “community rating.”\n",
            "The executive branch cannot, acting on its own, eliminate community rating altogether. But the Trump administration has fought hard to undermine it. In 2018, for example, it handed down a rule expanding the use of short term insurance plans to that do not cover many services, and that may exclude people with preexisting conditions.\n",
            "The mere existence of these plans can drive up premiums for people with expensive preexisting conditions, because these skimpy plans will lure healthy consumers away from more generous plans. That risks creating a segregated market. Healthy consumers will buy cheap, watered-down plans, while people with expensive medical conditions will be concentrated into much more expensive plans.\n",
            "In Congress, meanwhile, Trump supported legislation seeking to repeal Obamacare or drastically water down its protections. One bill backed by Trump, the American Health Care Act, would have allowed many insurers to charge higher premiums — potentially prohibitively high premiums — to patients with preexisting conditions.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the Trump administration is currently asking the courts to repeal Obamacare almost in its entirety. If the courts ultimately embrace the administration’s position, that will mean that all of Obamacare’s protections for people with preexisting conditions will be struck down.\n",
            "Trump, it’s worth noting, has a history of claiming that he will protect Americans’ access to health care, then pushing policies that would strip health coverage from millions of Americans. He claimed in 2015, for example, to be the “first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,” but his 2020 budget proposal would cut Medicaid spending by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.\n",
            "Title:  Billions of wire hangers are used in the US every year. Almost no one buys them. \n",
            "url:  https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/6/21113481/wire-hangers-history-use\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "If you are like many Americans, you likely own or have owned a small collection of the billions (with a b) of wire hangers that are consumed in the US every year. And, also like many Americans, you probably came to your stockpile unwittingly — largely through trips to the dry cleaner — and are familiar with the fit of frustration that comes from opening your closet to find these forgotten objects somehow entangled in a metal mare’s nest.\n",
            "In the early 1990s, art dealer Frank Maresca had the unusual experience of such a collection being a sort of godsend. He needed a “throwaway show” for his New York City gallery — something simple and easy to occupy a fallow period on the calendar. His friend and artist-collector Harris Diamant offered an unexpected solution: his extensive reserve of vintage clothes hangers.\n",
            "Maresca, whose Ricco/Maresca Gallery is known for showcasing contemporary outsider art, mounted one of Diamant’s wire hangers on the white gallery wall. Encouraged, he pinned up 169 more. Soon Maresca had an exhibit (“Out of the Closet: American Hangers”) and an accompanying write-up in the New York Times. “Stop laughing,” reporter N.R. Kleinfield told readers. Within a few days, thanks to, ahem, wire services picking up the story, the exhibit went the print-era equivalent of viral. Soon the office fax machine was spitting out messages until they flooded onto the floor. Daily foot traffic increased into the hundreds. The mailman dropped off entire canvas sacks of letters from citizens the world over who hoped to convert their own closets into cultural cachet and/or cash.\n",
            "“The whole thing was funny,” Maresca says. “I mean, who ever gave a moment’s thought to a hanger?”\n",
            "Therein lies the unusual status of the wire hanger: an inescapable part of modern life to which everyone can relate but no one pays much attention. A 2007 study by the US International Trade Commission estimated US consumption at 3.3 billion wire hangers annually, or nearly 11 per capita at the time — a figure that does not even account for the wire hangers often included with “floor-ready” garments imported from overseas, as long required by major retailers like Macy’s and Lord and Taylor. Upward of 80 percent of US wire hanger consumption comes via dry cleaners (uniform rental services comprise much of the rest), which employ wire hangers as a means of garment storage and transport so cost-effective they are included with their services.\n",
            "It is wire hangers’ very ubiquity that may have helped damn them to dangle from the lowest rung on the hanger hierarchy. Of course, it doesn’t help that wire hangers are not particularly good at being hangers, often warping delicate garments that drape from them unevenly, nor that they are still the go-to symbol of illegal abortions in America’s pre-Roe dark days. Their most enduring pop culture moment came in a disturbing and class-conscious depiction of child abuse, when Faye Dunaway famously shrieked “NO... WIRE... HANGERS!” in the 1981 Joan Crawford biopic Mommie Dearest (surely undoing the goodwill engendered by Halloween’s closet scene three years earlier). No less an authority than the so-called Hanger King himself, industry magnate Bernie Spitz, once proclaimed that he would never sell them.\n",
            "And yet wire hangers pioneered the form. It is commonly held, by those who commonly hold such things, that the hanger’s origins trace to an 1869 patent by a Connecticut man named O.A. North, who designed what he termed an “improvement in clothes-hook” made from “bent-metal rod or wire.” (This crediting is questionable: an 1852 patent for a shoulder-shaped metal wall hanger by fellow Connecticuter W.B. Olds clearly predates North’s, while other predating patents from 1867 and 1868 also more closely resemble modern hangers. If at least some of these were born independent of one another, it would suggest a fitting inevitability.)\n",
            "It is no coincidence that this time of more obviously groundbreaking invention is what also produced the humble hanger. Not until the Industrial Revolution streamlined the manufacturing and shipping processes did most Americans even own enough garments to warrant considerable storage. Homes built in that era did not typically include closets; most Americans kept unworn clothes folded in chests or hung on wall-mounted rods. (Or, in the case of Thomas Jefferson, on a personal contraption dubbed a “turning-machine.”)\n",
            "Once people had clothes, they soon had hangers, and once they had hangers they soon had them in excess. As far back as the 1960s, the Times was advising its readers on using wire hangers to construct bird feeders or a skillet to cook fish over a fire. Other extracurricular uses became more common: replacing or augmenting TV antennae, breaking into cars, rescuing misplaced keys and rings and baseballs from sewer grates. Wire hangers have even become a medium for artworks and accessory to a $900 Moschino dress mimicking dry cleaner packaging, while the internet’s DIY economy has reliably employed them as easy fodder for listicles and lifehack videos. The premise of these how-tos is familiar: Of course you have wire hangers and of course they are awaiting better use. They are, always, just sort of there.\n",
            "When Milton Magnus III was a boy in Alabama, a friend asked what his father did. Magnus told his friend that his father, just like his father before him, manufactured and sold wire hangers. His friend was taken aback. In his childhood naivete, he had never considered that they were manufactured or sold at all. “Everybody doesn’t think about it until someone says, ‘I make hangers,’” Magnus says, “and then: ‘Oh my goodness, I guess somebody has to.’”\n",
            "Magnus is now president of M&B Hangers, the company his grandfather, also named Milton Magnus, co-founded in 1943 after a local dry cleaner complained that the war effort’s steel consumption had led to a shortage of wire hangers. (The eldest Milton and his business partner, Roy Brekle, had previously been reselling used bottle caps to soda makers.) Magnus III had at first pursued a veterinary career until in college, he says, “chemistry and biology and I didn’t really agree.” He began loading M&B trucks during summer breaks and has been with the company since; his son, Milton IV, is now an M&B sales associate, the fourth generation in America’s preeminent wire hanger dynasty.\n",
            "“We don’t worship them or anything like that,” says Magnus III, whose email signature touts M&B’s “unbending commitment.” “We just know that our livelihood depends on it.”\n",
            "Not long ago, the Magnuses had more domestic company in the industry. As recently as the mid-2000s, the US boasted seven major wire hanger manufacturers; by the end of that decade, M&B was the last such company standing. (At least two others, Indy Hanger and U.S. Hanger Co., have since emerged.) In a common story of modern capitalism, the wire hanger industry’s contraction is tied to increased global competition. In the early 2000s, Chinese manufacturers began flooding the market with cheaper products — priced lower by an average of 30 percent compared to domestic hangers — that many feared were intended to drive out US competitors, a process known as “dumping.”\n",
            "In 2007, M&B successfully petitioned the US International Trade Commission to issue a report recommending tariffs on Chinese imports. The ITC’s findings were stark: between 2005 and 2007, Chinese wire hanger imports had increased from one billion hangers annually to 2.7 billion, bringing their share of the US market up from 36 percent to 81 percent. At the same time, as stateside manufacturers folded, the domestic industry’s production capacity halved; during the course of the investigation alone, two US companies shuttered their factories and pivoted to importing.\n",
            "The George W. Bush administration, which had declined such action in its first term, imposed tariffs on Chinese wire hanger imports. That drove up prices — an imported box of 500 lept from around $17.50 to nearly $40 — and triggered a rare wave of media attention concerning its potential effects on dry cleaners and their customers. Although, as Magnus III argued to NPR at the time, “If I pay $12.95 to have my suit cleaned and that hanger cost [the cleaner] a cent and a half more, that’s $12.96 and a half. It’s not a factor.”\n",
            "A follow-up report from the ITC last year illustrated the tariffs’ effects. In 2018, just 25.9 million wire hangers were imported from China, or less than 1 percent of the pre-tariff total. Yet imports themselves still totaled a sizable 1.45 billion, and their shifting sources over the preceding decade had produced a game of regulatory whack-a-mole: There are now also Obama-era tariffs on hangers imported from Taiwan and Vietnam, where it was determined that Chinese products were being shipped and repackaged to evade US customs. In 2011, two Tijuana-based importers received jail time in California for similarly rebranding Chinese-made, US-bound hangers as products of Mexico.\n",
            "Two years ago, a crackdown on one such fraudulent manufacturer in Southeast Asia disrupted the usual supply chain. Suddenly without a significant source, importers flooded legitimate makers with orders, creating months-long shipment backups. “It was panic time,” says Mike Ross, owner of Massachusetts-based dry cleaner supplier AristoCraft. Did prices go up as a result? “They did,” Ross says. “Not dramatically, though.” In other words, it’s unlikely anyone else noticed.\n",
            "Despite their seeming disposability, discarding wire hangers can be complicated. One estimate from the US Department of Commerce puts the annual number deposited in landfills at 3.5 billion, which equates to nearly 200 million pounds of steel. There are ways to reduce consumption (many dry cleaners accept customers’ hangers for re-use, and companies like Pennsylvania’s Allied Services have collected, cleaned, and re-circulated millions) and ways to recycle (Magnus, whose company uses recycled steel to make its hangers, sells his extras to a scrap company). But doing so on a mass scale is difficult given that they are so often consumed incidentally and that their shape and coating can be problematic for the machines often used in mass recycling programs.\n",
            "In an increasingly eco-conscious consumer culture, this has created an opening for competition. In the late 2000s, an entrepreneur named J.D. Schulman continued Connecticut’s tradition of hanger innovation by offering dry cleaners free biodegradable paper hangers emblazoned with corporate ads, but his company’s website is no longer online. At times, others have cropped up made from corn and wheat. Yet all have failed to displace the wire hanger for the same reasons that wood and plastic varieties are not your dry cleaner’s choice: Wire ones do the job as cheaply as possible.\n",
            "Which is not to say that wire hangers are completely insulated from outside pressures. Beginning about 20 years ago, 18-inch hangers supplanted 16-inchers as the industry standard, in accordance with the American masses’ increasing masses. Around the same time, M&B debuted a more rounded “knit shirt hanger” for polos and the like, now one of three-dozen varieties (along with the Ultimate King Shirt Hanger and Extreme Ultimate Shirt Hanger) that can be ordered or, more entertainingly, viewed in 3-D animations on the company’s website. Among the industry’s biggest threats, says Magnus, are the Silicon Valley-driven trends of casual workplaces and working from home, which reduce the demand for dry cleaning and in turn wire hangers.\n",
            "One unlikely place wire hangers have maintained their appeal is the well-appointed country residence of former D.C. Comics president Jenette Kahn (located, appropriately, in Connecticut). Kahn attended the Ricco/Maresca gallery show in 1991 and was reminded of the wire sculptures made by Alexander Calder. Smitten, she forked over a now-forgotten sum — according to the Times, a quarter of the collection was listed for $15,000 — in order to own them for herself.\n",
            "Nearly three decades on, some two dozen hangers remain displayed on a white wall above a colorful Godley-Schwan sideboard, opposite Sandy Skoglund’s 1979 photo “Hangers.” “I’ve always been known for my very personal taste,” explains Kahn, whose decorative flourishes also include Jean Cocteau plates and works by Sots Art pioneers Komar and Melamid.\n",
            "But even Kahn’s appetite had its limit; she bought but a fraction of the 170 in the original gallery exhibition. Says Kahn, “I don’t know what I would have ever done with 170.”\n",

            "url:  https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20875821/black-immigrants-school-prison-deportation-pipeline\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "When public defender Sophia Gurulé tried to visit her client in ICE detention in June, she was hit with a roadblock: His facility in Bergen County, New Jersey, was under quarantine due to a mumps outbreak. She wouldn’t be able to talk to her client in person for the next three weeks.\n",
            "For 25-year-old Ousman Darboe, daily communication with his legal representation is essential. In May, he lost his removal proceedings case in immigration court. Now, he is pending deportation to his birth country of Gambia.\n",
            "While he was quarantined in a unit with little air ventilation in the middle of summer — his family a two-hour bus commute away in the Bronx — Gurulé has been fervently at work on an appeal. She is exploring all options, including sending a letter to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for his release. This is the final chance she has to help keep his family together. Darboe has never held his daughter, now 17 months old, outside of a detention facility.\n",
            "Like many of the approximately 10.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, Darboe came to the country as a child. He was 6 years old when his parents brought him and his three older siblings to New York in 2001, settling in the Fordham Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, one of the poorest congressional districts in the country.\n",
            "Navigating life in a strict Muslim home, where he helped care for his younger siblings, was occasionally at odds with his assimilation as a kid in Fordham Heights. But Darboe worked quickly to fit in. He shed his accent and learned English. He played basketball and often kept quiet. And, much to his family’s disapproval, he sometimes cut school, often to avoid the heavy violence and policing on campus.\n",
            "Based on the color of his skin alone, it’s not a surprise that Darboe went on to face numerous interactions with law enforcement as a teenager and young adult — a series of stops, alleged misidentifications, and arrests that led him to be locked up in Bergen County.\n",
            "According to the Bureau of Justice of Statistics, black and Latinx residents are more likely to be stopped by police than white residents, and when stopped, police are twice as likely to threaten or use force against them. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, these statistics are even starker in New York City: Black and Latinx people were the targets of four out of every five reported stops between 2014 and 2017, and black and Latinx people were more likely to have force used against them.\n",
            "But as many immigrant justice advocates will tell you, if being black makes you a police target, then being black and undocumented in a poor neighborhood will make you vulnerable to surveillance, punishment, and exile. Darboe wasn’t born of privileged social class or with means to a prestigious education; he did not fit the “exceptional immigrant” model preferred by US immigration policy. The odds of Darboe living not only a free life, but any life at all in this country, were stacked against him from the moment he stepped on US soil.\n",
            "Darboe has instead found himself in what criminal justice reform activists call the prison-to-deportation pipeline, a coded system that works to funnel black and Latinx immigrants from the criminal court system into Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) custody, to the immigration court system, and ultimately back to their nations of birth — with very little recourse or space for adjudication.\n",
            "For example, low-level crimes such as marijuana possession are lumped into the offense of “drug trafficking” in immigration court — even if it’s recognized as a misdemeanor in the criminal courts — mandating automatic deportation without any leeway for a judge to consider an individual’s circumstances, according to Human Rights Watch. As a result of this one-size-fits-all policy, deportations over drug convictions of any sort increased 43 percent from 2007 to 2012.\n",
            "Peel back the numbers further, and black immigrants make up a disproportionate amount of criminal-based deportations. According to the advocacy group Black Alliance for Just Immigration, which reviewed data on immigrants from African and Caribbean countries from the Department of Homeland Security Yearbook and the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, 76 percent of black immigrants are deported on criminal grounds, compared to 45 percent of all immigrants. Despite making up only 7.2 percent of the noncitizen population in the US, more than 20 percent of people facing deportation on criminal grounds are black.\n",
            "“There’s a particular intersection of vulnerability — immigrants in general are vulnerable, and there’s often poverty and racial aspects to their vulnerability as well,” said Jodi Ziesemer, director of the Immigrant Protection Unit at the New York Legal Assistance Group, a nonprofit that provides comprehensive free legal services and advocacy. “Black and undocumented immigrants are at particular risk because they’re targeted racially by a lot of our institutions ... while being also targeted for ICE and enforcement actions.”\n",
            "As a young quiet kid, Darboe would have never guessed that his existence in the US — and in the Bronx in particular — would put him on a trajectory of altercations with law enforcement, eventual incarceration, and possible deportation. Darboe’s sister Adama said her brother once told her, “I came to this country thinking it would be better for me, but they’re actually against me.”\n",
            "Darboe’s first interaction with police came at age 16: On June 25, 2010, he was falsely accused of stealing headphones at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Jerome Park neighborhood of the Bronx. Situated just around the corner from the famed specialized high school Bronx High School of Science, DeWitt has a history of police patrolling the hallways and metal detectors that caused hour-long delays, a system that left students feeling “like inmates,” according to a 2005 New York Times report. It was a situation so toxic that more than 1,500 students marched over to the Department of Education at the beginning of the school year.\n",
            "When Darboe was at the school five years later, not much had changed. He told the court earlier this year that there were a lot of gang wars, fights, and cuttings. “DeWitt Clinton was a harsh place to go to school, because most of the time there’s gang wars — there’s weapons being found at school,” Darboe testified. “Basically nobody went to class.” Gurulé says Darboe witnessed police being given free rein to stroll the school, on top of the standard school security that already existed on campus. (DeWitt Clinton High School has not responded to Vox’s request for comment).\n",
            "His eldest sister, Adama, in contrast, went to Marble Hill High School for International Studies, a smaller school with an above-average reputation and an emphasis on dedicating resources to college preparation. Adama tells Vox these schooling differences significantly impacted the siblings’ trajectories, placing Darboe in an environment that put him under police scrutiny, and with a friend group that grew accustomed to being viewed as criminals.\n",
            "Though Darboe was quickly found not to have stolen the headphones and his case was dismissed, the incident would prove to be the first in a long string of interactions with police. According to court documents, Darboe said that while the kids in Fordham Heights were “not the best of influences,” they would often be “attacked by the police officers” because the neighborhood was simply known to be violent.\n",
            "“Broken windows” policing was common in neighborhoods with large black and Latinx immigrant populations such as Darboe’s area of the Bronx. By focusing on low-level crimes in so-called unkempt neighborhoods — with vandalism, loitering, and drug offenses — police departments theorized they could prevent bigger crimes from happening there. In the 1990s, police in cities like New York took this practice one step further and instead of waiting for people to commit misdemeanors, they enacted “stop-and-frisk” — stopping, questioning, and frisking anyone who looked suspicious.\n",
            "According to a 2013 study by the Vera Institute of Justice, at least half of all recorded stops by police in New York City involved people between the ages of 13 and 25, and more than 40 percent of young people who’ve been stopped said they have been stopped nine times or more — with nearly half reporting that threats or physical violence were used against them. Broken windows and stop-and-frisk policing created an environment where kids from certain neighborhoods, and often of a certain skin color, were repeatedly profiled as criminals. In fact, in 2013, a US district judge in New York ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional and ordered police to stop the practice in the Bronx specifically, because of the way it targeted young black and Latinx men.\n",
            "But that ruling — which outlawed stop-and-frisk but didn’t put an end to broken windows policing — came several years after Darboe was already caught up in the system.\n",
            "In October 2010, four months after being falsely accused of stealing the headphones, Darboe was fingered for stealing a purse and was adjudicated as a youthful offender. When asked in court why he stole it, Darboe said that he didn’t have any school supplies, or a book bag, and he couldn’t ask his parents because he knew they didn’t have the money. “I felt, I felt bad because I felt like I had to take [a] drastic measure to get the stuff that I needed,” he said.\n",
            "Three months later, in the following January, he was stopped and frisked on Webster Avenue — just down the block from his childhood home — and charged with marijuana possession, but was only found guilty of disorderly conduct. And in March 2012, he was charged for cellphone theft, which landed him in Rikers Island — a jail complex infamous for its excessive use of violence in inmate discipline — as a violation of his previous youthful offender agreement over the purse theft.\n",
            "During his time at Rikers, having just turned 18 and awaiting his cellphone theft hearing, Darboe spent nearly 10 months total in solitary confinement for fighting, and five of those months he says he was not even aware he was able to step outside for an hour a day and get fresh air.\n",
            "When he was finally sentenced in July 2013, Darboe was sent to Greene Correctional Facility in upstate New York to serve time for both petty theft charges; nine months later, he was released on parole — meaning that he spent more time in pre-trial detention awaiting his sentencing than his actual sentence. His disappearance was so abrupt that his longtime friend from high school, Lashalle Poston, now his wife, initially thought he had left the city. “At first I thought, African parents, when they get in trouble, they send their kids to Africa,” Poston tells Vox. “He just disappeared.”\n",
            "Despite having spent the latter half of his teen years being in and out of facilities, a youth offender record is not a criminal record; it is automatically sealed and does not have to be reported as a criminal conviction. “It wouldn’t bar him from applying for things,” Gurulé said, referring to documentation that wouldn’t leave him vulnerable to deportation. “A judge can be, ‘I see you got arrested for doing that and I don’t like that, that makes me think you’re a bad person,’ but it doesn’t bar him for applying.”\n",
            "So upon his release in 2014, at age 20, Darboe took steps to make a fresh start. He moved back in with his parents; started dating Poston, who served as his support system during his incarceration; and began attending Getting Out and Staying Out, a Rikers reentry program for young adult men.\n",
            "But despite his best intentions, staying out would prove to be not so easy.\n",
            "In September 2014, less than six months after Darboe’s release, a neighbor in his parents’ building was walking when she had her gold chains robbed from her neck. Given that he was recently paroled, Darboe was identified as a person of interest by the NYPD. Darboe says on the day of the incident he was at Getting Out and Staying Out (the organization was only able to confirm his regular participation but not his specific whereabouts that day, according to court documents).\n",
            "When police searched his belongings, they were unable to find any items that tied him to the description given by the neighbor. However, the victim identified him in a police lineup, both recognizing him as a resident in the building and perceiving him to be the assailant: “She thinks that he did it because it was a ‘big black man,’” Adama says, “and [that’s who] Ousman was.”\n",
            "Darboe was charged with multiple offenses — three counts of robbery plus assault, criminal possession of stolen property, and harassment. He was now considered an adult. At his arraignment, he entered an initial plea of not guilty and was released on bail after 60 days.\n",
            "But his release was turbulent: He had multiple police interactions for a variety of unrelated charges, such as gun possession and possession of a false check, both of which were dismissed (they were committed by an associate of his, according to court documents). He then landed back in Rikers because the robbery charges were a violation of his parole. While in jail, he was accused of illegally possessing a razor, an offense of which he was acquitted.\n",
            "Worn down from being in and out of detainment and solitary confinement — and fearful that the NYPD, in its persistence to obtain evidence, would generate a second witness willing to corroborate the alleged robbery story to better their own circumstances — Darboe made an about-face in February 2017 and took a plea deal of one count of felony robbery for time served. According to court documents, Darboe said he took the deal because he was disappointed in himself — not because he had committed the crime, which he maintains he did not, but because of his past. “I had to blame myself for my previous cases, because if I would have never caught [charges in] those previous robberies, I would have never been a target for [the gold chains] robbery.”\n",
            "While pleading under duress is a common scenario for black men with extended stays in pre-trial detention, doing so has significant implications for immigrants.\n",
            "Five months later, Darboe was at his parents’ apartment in their new Bronx neighborhood of Kingsbridge when ICE knocked on the door. Even though his recent case dismissals meant he was supposedly no longer under threat of incarceration, ICE officers gained entry to the apartment saying they were police, under the pretense of having a warrant for someone else in the neighborhood, says Gurulé. This tactic is reportedly used by some agents to get immigrants to let them in a residence: ICE officers announce that they’re law enforcement and that they have a “warrant,” even though the warrant is only administrative and not signed by a judge.\n",
            "Once inside, agents proceed to make arrests after they validate that the person in the home is the same person who may be already flagged on their watchlist as a target, with a particular emphasis on undocumented persons. (ICE has not responded to Vox’s request for comment on its arrest or warrant process, or Darboe specifically, but an ICE spokesman denied to Documented in 2018 that they pose as local law enforcement; however, he said ICE “may use the universally recognized ‘POLICE’ when initially making contact with someone during a field operation.”)\n",
            "This is the kind of tactic advocates and lawyers warned immigrants to guard against during the recent ICE raids announced by the Trump administration. But Darboe didn’t know that the warrant wasn’t signed by a judge, and that he was thus protected by the Fourth Amendment from having to open the door. He was quickly taken away by ICE agents to the Hudson County Detention Center in New Jersey.\n",
            "Darboe was detained on July 31, 2017 — the same day he was scheduled to have his forged check charge dismissed. A handful of days later, his girlfriend Poston discovered she was pregnant with their first child — a girl, Sanai, to be born the following April. She wouldn’t be able to visit Darboe for four months.\n",
            "Outside of transferring facilities to Bergen County, Darboe has not left ICE custody since July 2017, having been denied bond after an extended delay due to “dangerousness,” according to a judge in the NYC immigration court. This is despite having only one adult conviction and significant roots in the city: He has eight siblings and parents who, at this point, are all legal permanent residents or have birthright citizenship. He also married Poston in Hudson County Detention in December 2017.\n",
            "Poston’s initial I-130 petition, the first step to authenticate and establish a record of marriage in the visa application process, was denied by the United States Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), stating that the couple did not have joint assets such as property or bank accounts, and therefore the marriage was possibly fraudulent. (When asked for comment, USCIS told Vox it doesn’t comment on specific cases.)\n",
            "“They tried to tell me that we didn’t submit enough evidence, that my relationship wasn’t real,” Poston tells Vox. “Me pushing out a kid in labor for 29 hours wasn’t enough?”\n",
            "While the decision was ultimately overturned on appeal, Gurulé points out that the logic behind the authentication is classist. She notes that in tandem with ICE, the USCIS “has become a form of law enforcement in their own way,” expanding from an organization intended to manage benefits and services for immigrants to an investigation service of its own.\n",
            "The delays in the spousal visa process extended Darboe’s detention by ICE for another year. In the meantime, Poston has navigated pregnancy and early motherhood alone.\n",
            "In 1996, the Clinton administration signed into law two key pieces of legislation: the  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which both served to retroactively tie immigration status to criminalization. Congress expanded what fell under its “aggravated felonies” classification when it came to deportable offenses, and standard deportation protocol could now be circumvented for “fast-track” removal proceedings. (Under the Trump administration, for example, an undocumented immigrant who cannot prove over two years of residency is eligible for “fast-track” proceedings.)\n",
            "Deportable offenses — previously, murder, drugs, and firearms trafficking — now included nonviolent felonies and misdemeanors, such as theft, filing a false tax return, illegal entry in and of itself, or failing to appear in court. During the Bush administration, the largest increases in deportations were of undocumented immigrants convicted of traffic violations: 43,000 total during his last five years in office.\n",
            "Even in the Obama era, immigration detention and deportations rates continued to rise astronomically: From 2009 to 2015, the administration engaged in over 1 million “interior” removals — excluding those who were apprehended while attempting to cross the border  —  a rate that was nearly double that of the prior administration. According to a New York Times’ analysis of internal government records, two-thirds of the deportation cases during the Obama administration involved immigrants who were either convicted of minor infractions or had not yet been convicted of a crime.\n",
            "Obama also played into the “good vs. bad immigrant” schism that has helped fuel hostility toward immigrants in this country: His infamous “Felons, not Families” speech kicking off the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program failed to reconcile immigration policy with the systemic surveilling and incarceration issues that plague people of color; he implied there is no scenario in which a person selected for deportation could be both a felon and part of a family.\n",
            "The “exceptional immigrant” paradigm was further reinforced by immigration reform that only emphasized pathways to citizenship for young immigrants who exhibit “good moral character.” Policies like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals established a temporary deferred status via a rubric that is difficult for many young immigrants to meet: The college-bound DREAMer, or undocumented immigrant in the armed services with a spotless police record, doesn’t represent the lived reality of many young immigrants. According to the United States Department of Education, 54 percent of undocumented youth earn a high school diploma, and only 5 to 10 percent of undocumented high school graduates enroll in a higher education institution — far fewer successfully graduate with a degree.\n",
            "“A spotlight on ‘exceptional’ black immigrants often erases and makes invisible the lived experience of black immigrants who experience police brutality, state surveillance, poverty, and workplace discrimination, among other things,” says Nekessa Opoti, a communications strategist at the UndocuBlack Network, an advocacy organization comprised of black immigrants.\n",
            "This is a plight that Darboe knows very well: He was not a perfect student. His case does not make for an exceptional immigrant soundbite. It’s easy to look at Darboe’s rap sheet and dismiss him as someone who has continually erred, particularly as a teen, and is therefore not entitled to sympathy.\n",
            "This is the fundamental shortcoming of the emphasis on “model minority” narratives: They lack space for the acceptance of a world in which an immigrant lived a “regular” life, especially one that’s subject to heavy police surveillance. Attending an over-policed high school where students were constantly under suspicion, living in a neighborhood where the color of his skin was enough for police to stop him, Darboe had little chance of being seen as a model citizen.\n",
            "He certainly wouldn’t be given much of a chance to grow up and turn his life around; he wouldn’t even be seen as worthy of such an opportunity.\n",
            "His daughter, he said in immigration court earlier this year, “helps me feel that I got something to fight for, that I got something to go to, that ... I really got to stop doing what I was doing my previous years as a teenager. Now I got to mature, not only for me, but only to be a better example for my daughter.”\n",
            "Darboe’s youthful offenses — pilfering a cellphone and a purse as a teenager — are far from the actions of MS-13 villains trotted out by the Trump administration to justify strict immigration policy. But such indiscretions are much more common reasons for being removed from this country than any salacious violence.\n",
            "Even when there are laws in place to ostensibly help immigrants understand the criminal court process, they can fail. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Padilla v. Kentucky that criminal defenders must ask their clients about their immigration status so they can inform them of the possible deportation consequences of a guilty plea before sentencing.\n",
            "“That should happen,” Ziesemer says. But because courts are often backed up and public defenders often have massive caseloads, “I think there’s a lot of pressure on both ends that make that not a perfect system and … are not super protective of due process rights,” she says.\n",
            "This gap in due process even happens in places like New York City, which have reputations as “sanctuary cities” and are supposed to limit their cooperation with ICE. But as the Intercept reports, ICE has evaded sanctuary rules by using NYPD fingerprint records to send letters to immigrants arrested — usually for low-level misdemeanor offenses — asking them to come into the agency’s Manhattan offices. In the cases of two immigrants who complied and went down to the office — neither of whom had open removal orders against them or criminal convictions — both were detained.\n",
            "As explained by Albert Saint Jean, the New York organizer for Black Alliance for Just Immigration, no matter how noncompliant a city administration vows to be, broken windows policing serves as a feeder system for ICE.\n",
            "“If you’re doing heavy policing in black neighborhoods in NYC, guess what? Undocumented people live in those neighborhoods too. When you’re policing heavily black and brown communities, that’s where the bulk of our immigrant community and undocumented community live. So in essence, every time these people get fingerprinted, every time these things happen … ICE gets notified.”\n",
            "Subway fare evasion is one of the top reasons that both Ziesemer and Saint Jean say their New York clients have been flagged for immigration purposes. In 2018, 90 percent of those arrested for this crime were reported to be people of color. This will only continue with Gov. Cuomo’s announced plan to expand the police force dedicated to fare evasion from 30 cops at 15 key New York City stations to 500 officers across 100 stations and bus stops.\n",
            "Ziesemer says she has a client who is Garifuna from Honduras who got ticketed for having an open container in the Bronx. “If he wasn’t an immigrant, he would have paid a small fine and that would have been the end of it,” she says. “But because that got routed into the immigration system, he got picked up and has been detained for over six months.”\n",
            "When immigrants are detained, Ziesemer says, “there’s no obligation for ICE to bring them in front of a court, for them to seek bond. There’s no appointed attorney, there’s very little recourse to getting out of detention on a sort of pre-trial basis.” It’s called “civil detention,” she says, “but in reality, these people in Bergen County and all these other jails, they’re literally housed alongside people who have been convicted of crimes. Immigrants really do fall down a black hole when they’re detained.”\n",
            "Some detained immigrants are allowed video testimony, which still isn’t standing before a judge and advocating for their own character. This has increasingly become the default for immigration courts around the country, according to Gurulé, and organizations have been suing over the violation of people’s due process.\n",
            "One exception to the “black hole” norm was the high-profile detention of black immigrant 21 Savage — born Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph — in February. The rapper was detained by Atlanta ICE agents days after criticizing the agency on The Tonight Show. While ICE claimed Savage was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who came to the US as a teen and overstayed his visa, he had been living in Atlanta since he was seven. The incident was a shocking moment for many people, highlighting the power of ICE, and disrupting the image for many of what an undocumented immigrant could look like — black and famous.\n",
            "Fortunately for 21 Savage, he had hefty legal support and the backing of Jay-Z to help prevent being buried in ICE’s system. However, most black immigrants do not have access to the resources afforded to celebrities. In Darboe’s case, his access to legal representation was courtesy of a New York City Council-funded initiative to protect low-income immigrants facing deportation called the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, of which Gurulé’s firm, the Bronx Defenders, is a part.\n",
            "“I would say more than half the asylum cases that I’ve gone for, they were people that you could see a pattern of police harassment,” says Saint Jean of his work as an organizer for Black Alliance for Just Immigration in NYC. “And the judges don’t look at it from that context. They look at it as ‘this person is a troublemaker.’”\n",
            "Countless immigration activists do the work of trying to place these clients with proper legal representation, which can sometimes feel nearly impossible, with lawyers wanting to get nowhere near immigration cases that involve rap sheets. In Darboe’s case, when Poston testified that her husband had grown past his youth offenses, the prosecutor replied, “talk is cheap,” asking Poston, “What if he gets violent with you or your child?” even though Darboe has no record of violent offenses.\n",
            "“[I think the judge] feels like, all black women go through that, and you’ll just be one more, and it’s fine ... The system is helping you, you don’t need no other help from no man,” says Poston. “The system is actually not that goddamn easy.”\n",
            "Poston has had to experience this firsthand. In the time that she has worked to advocate for her husband, obtaining Gurulé as his public defender, and attending all his necessary court dates, she temporarily lost a job and has settled into a shelter with their daughter.\n",
            "“These judges see his kind of contact with the criminal legal system, and all reason and empathy flies out the door,” Gurulé says of her client Darboe. “No empathy, compassion, no sense of justice, nothing.”\n",
            "If Darboe is deported, he will be excised from his community, family, and daughter, whom he may never see grow up. His emotional and mental health would also likely take a significant hit; deportees often suffer from depression and social isolation. Then there is Gambia, where the government is still working to stabilize society after a 20-year regime of human rights abuses left the country with high unemployment rates and in bankruptcy.\n",
            "In the meantime, Darboe continues to wait. The mumps outbreak in Bergen County is over, and his appeal date is scheduled for October 3. He is relying on his Islamic faith to keep his spirit strong. He and his family know, though, that they must brace for the worst. After his two years in detention, they must come to terms with what has been the fate of many undocumented immigrants before him.\n",
            "Update: On February 3, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unconditionally pardoned Ousman Darboe. He currently remains in ICE custody and is about to spend his third birthday in immigration detention. His community continues to demand his immediate release.\n",
            "Title:  I love movies. That’s why I hate the Oscars. \n",
            "url:  https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/1/29/21060179/oscars-academy-awards-season\n",
            "Context: \n",
            "\n",
            "My table at the 85th New York Film Critics Circle gala in early January was near the back of the cavernous main room at the posh nightclub Tao Downtown, where the lights are kept dim. So I could see Antonio Banderas’s figure but only barely make out his features as he stood at the podium to collect the Best Actor award for Pain & Glory, which my colleagues and I had voted to give him.\n",
            "His demeanor as he accepted his award spoke volumes. After talking about how delighted and honored he was, he explained that he had to get on a plane right away to leave for Spain, where he’s performing onstage in A Chorus Line. Those shows have meant he hasn’t been as aggressive on the Oscar campaign trail this season as his main competitors, including Joker’s Joaquin Phoenix, Marriage Story’s Adam Driver, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s Leonardo DiCaprio. Instead, he talked about getting off the flight and going straight to the theater, delirious with exhaustion and jet lag.\n",
            "As he said this, Banderas’s shoulders sagged slightly. “I am tired of campaigning,” he blurted out, in a moment of uncommon honesty for any actor during the tightly controlled awards season. “I am not a politician!” He straightened up and smiled. “I am an actor!”\n",
            "Antonio, I get it. The Oscar race is a cross between a marathon and a political campaign, with high fashion and late-night parties thrown in, lots of courting favor and giving interviews and appearing at events and, basically, doing everything except making movies. It may look glamorous from the outside, but Banderas spoke the truth: It’s a slog.\n",
            "And what’s it actually for? Handing out prizes for the “best” art is perverse — and I say that as a member of several awards-giving bodies. I know humans have an innate need to pit things of a similar type against one another. I know competition has been wired into our DNA since we were living in caves. I know that for some, rivalries and tournaments and trying to win are as vital as air and water.\n",
            "But at least there are rules to play by in sports, and policy platforms to advance in politics, and you can measure, with some objectivity, the “winner,” whether by referee or by the votes of a constituency.\n",
            "Art, in contrast, is the most subjective thing humans make. It changes based on who’s looking at it. Something that moved you to tears leaves me stone-cold; something I found indelible, intricate, and well-designed makes you shrug. Art is as much the creation of its audience as its creator, and that’s what makes it important: When we watch a movie or read a book or observe a painting or listen to a symphony, our inner landscapes respond in ways that are distinct and, if we’re open to it, can change us, too.\n",
            "The Oscars, in particular, with their costly, glitzy, backbreaking campaign season and outsize influence on the way we talk about movies all year, feel at times diametrically opposed to the role art ought to play both in the lives of individuals and in broader society.\n",
            "But over years of covering the Oscars, living life according to a calendar dictated by the awards season — the fall festivals, the late-year prestige releases, the votes and awards galas, and, finally, the hectic weeks of scrambling to prognosticate who will win and mind-read the Academy that gives out the statuettes — I have begrudgingly come to understand that there might be some reason, if not to love the Oscars, then to at least see why they matter.\n",
            "The Oscars aim to immortalize the “best” movies of the year, a task that’s tricky but possible. Voters’ judgments are largely related to skill and craft, and the way a work interacts with the context in which it’s created and released.\n",
            "Some movies are indeed bad — I almost wrote “objectively” bad, but to be honest, I don’t truly believe objective badness exists in art. Even the word “bad” takes on different shades of meaning depending on who’s using it and how. When I say a movie is good or bad, I might be talking about the quality of its filmmaking or storytelling or authentic engagement with the world. When I say a movie is “great,” I might mean it’s well made, or I might just mean I love it. I can say Parasite is great, and I can say Cats is great, and I mean two very (very) different things.\n",
            "Anyhow, it’s not opining on movies that’s perverse to me, and good thing, since that’s how I make a living. It’s the practice of attaching awards to those opinions, crowning one movie homecoming king, electing a single performer the greatest of the year — in short, the whole enterprise of the Oscars and every award that leads up to them.\n",
            "Many people are very proud to announce to me, when they find out I’m a movie critic, that they “hate” the Oscars, by which they might mean they’re frustrated by hosting controversies or a lack of diversity among nominees, or just that they didn’t like something a winner said in a speech. Truth is, I don’t think most people who work in the movie business — or near it, as I do — actually like the Oscars either, but for very different reasons. The awards are an expensive (an Oscar campaign can cost upward of $10 million) and grueling exercise; they suck up all the conversation around movies for a good six months of the year; and they tend to reflect not the best movies of the year but the movie-est movies.\n",
            "Hollywood tends to favor prosthetic-aided imitations of famous historical figures, films that look very complicated to make, actors who lose or gain a lot of weight for their roles, and, above all, movies about Hollywood itself. And the movies that win Oscars tend to be the ones with the most money to spend on lavish campaign events that keep them in the minds of Academy voters.\n",
            "Even if the Oscars were a more modest affair, the enterprise of giving awards to art for being the best still makes me want to stab myself in the eye with my rhinestoned stiletto. Deciding whether Parasite is the “best,” rather than Marriage Story or Little Women or The Irishman, feels like being asked to decide what’s best: a ripe, succulent peach just picked from the tree; a sublime, freshly baked, buttery croissant; or a perfect bowl of ramen. I mean, I don’t know! You tell me!\n",
            "But those awards have lasting value for the people who get to take them home. Winning an Oscar means you make it into the history books, yes. But more importantly, you get to keep working. An Oscar is the ultimate résumé booster, far better than a Golden Globe or a Screen Actors Guild Award or a New York Film Critics Circle award (as much as it pains me to say it). It means you’ve arrived, and you can ask for more money and better jobs in the future. It doesn’t guarantee a long and happy career. But it sure helps.\n",
            "The Oscars also fill another cultural niche, one that matters to far more people.\n",
            "For many, especially Americans, the Oscars light the way through the crowded field of movies every year. In 2019, 786 movies were released theatrically in North America, and dozens more (at least) were released directly to digital platforms. Theatrical releases were actually down by about 90 from 2018, but that’s still an extraordinary number of movies. Watching movies is my job, and I still only saw about 300 last year, and only 225 or so were new releases. It’s impossible for an ordinary moviegoer, even an avid movie lover, to cope.\n",
            "Furthermore, eight of the 10 highest-grossing films both in North America and worldwide in 2019 were big franchise blockbusters owned (or in one case co-produced) by Disney. So it makes a lot of sense that Oscar movies become a kind of counterbalance to the blockbuster behemoths. Only one of the year’s top 10 earners, Joker, was nominated for Best Picture. Only two others, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Ford v Ferrari, cracked the $100 million mark domestically. “Prestige” movies just tend not to be the highest earners.\n",
            "Yet many people make a ritual of watching, or trying to watch, the full list of Best Picture nominees before the ceremony (which is three weeks earlier than usual this year, so good luck). Even if other, better movies also came out in the preceding 12 months, the Best Picture contenders are often a good place to start.\n",
            "The nominations for documentaries and international (formerly foreign-language) films also spotlight more niche films, some of which may depend on Oscar recognition to get distribution or find their way onto a broader variety of platforms. International films aren’t required to have had US distribution before they’re nominated, and documentaries may only have played at niche festivals, so many people won’t have had the opportunity to see them before they’re nominated. But once they’re on the list, independent and arthouse theaters, and even multiplexes, may screen them, and their digital releases may be hastened.\n",
            "Is it a perfect situation? No. But I’ve taken solace in the Oscars’ ability to get people to watch a vibrant but almost experimental documentary like the 2019 nominee Hale County This Morning, This Evening, or prod movie lovers into finally seeing the 2012 Foreign Language winner Amour (which was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay). Sure, important movies get shut out all the time, as the stunning Korean thriller Burning did last year. But some break through.\n",
            "If we could halt the Oscars after the nominees are announced and just celebrate those lists, I’d be a lot happier. It’s not that everyone deserves a trophy — it’s that picking between them does some disservice to the movies themselves, narrowing history’s focus to the winners, some of which don’t deserve the attention. (The list of Best Picture winners from the past decade has some highs — Moonlight and Spotlight spring to mind — but it certainly has the Green Books and Argos to match.)\n",
            "But I suppose the possibility of bad choices along with the good just comes with the territory. I don’t anticipate ever loving the Oscars. But I’m trying — like Antonio Banderas, I guess — to see the bright side. The politicking is bad and the campaigning is wearisome, and I’ll be so glad when it’s all over for the year. Because in the end, what I really love is the movies.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "The magic number to win the Democratic Party’s nomination for president is 1,990 delegates. It could take months to officially get there.\n",
            "Presidential candidates are all competing for a majority of 3,979 pledged delegates. Separately, there are also 771 automatic delegates, otherwise known as “superdelegates.” But after a contentious 2016 primary, the Democratic National Committee changed its rules around superdelegates so they may now vote on the first ballot to select a nominee at the Democratic National Convention only if a campaign has secured a supermajority of pledged delegates. (Otherwise, they weigh in in the event of a second round of voting at the convention.)\n",
            "Candidates are competing for these delegates against a backdrop of complex rules: Delegates are awarded proportionally, and most states and districts require a minimum threshold of 15 percent of the primary or caucus vote to earn pledged delegates. This makes the contest a bit fairer, but also means it’s much harder to secure that magic number in a contested primary until much later in the year.\n",
            "The Iowa caucuses officially kicked off the delegate race. But while the early states are all about gaining momentum, the race is ultimately about who can bag the most delegates and get to that magic number.\n",
            "This could all be over very quickly if one candidate racks up an insurmountable lead and emerges from a crowded pack, or it could drag on into the spring and summer, ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July.\n",
            "Vox has a delegate tracker, in partnership with our friends at Decision Desk and the Virginia Institute of Politics.\n",
            "It’s easiest to think about the primary race in three phases, as we explained in our primary calendar.\n",
            "The four earliest states don’t contain a lot of delegates, but they act to winnow the field to its most serious contenders. This will be especially important this year, with more than 10 candidates still in the race.\n",
            "Winnowing the field is half the battle. The race to bag delegates starts in earnest on Super Tuesday.\n",
            "“It’s a virtual national primary because there are so many states. The math itself changes, and every network has some sort of chart showing the projected delegate count,” longtime California Democratic consultant Bill Carrick told Vox recently.\n",
            "And this is not just about winning states, it’s also about winning delegates at a congressional district level. Most states award both delegates based on state-level totals as well as delegates in each individual district. District-level delegates are the voters and local activists who sign up through their state party to act as delegates — together they make up the vast majority of eligible delegates.\n",
            "It is critical for Democratic candidates to get at least a 15 percent threshold in states or individual congressional districts in order to qualify for pledged delegates. And a big part of figuring out delegate math means campaigns have to focus on crunching the numbers to target certain districts with demographics that could be favorable for them.\n",
            "Here’s a breakdown of the delegate math, both pledged delegates and automatic delegates:\n",
            "District level: 2,591\n",
            "At-large: 898\n",
            "Party leaders and state and local elected officials (PLEO): 490\n",
            "Total: 3,979\n",
            "Democratic National Committee members: 445\n",
            "Democratic members of Congress: 280\n",
            "Democratic governors: 24\n",
            "Party leaders: 22\n",
            "Total: 771\n",
            "Again, it’s worth noting the biggest DNC rules changes were around superdelegates. That means these 771 superdelegates will largely sit on the sidelines on the first ballot, unless there’s already a candidate with a supermajority of pledged delegates.\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "When President Donald Trump began the 2020 State of the Union, a chant broke out among the assembled Republican members of Congress: “Four more years! Four more years!” The chant turned the subtext of the speech into the text: This is the formal launch of Trump’s reelection campaign.\n",
            "Not that it wasn’t obvious from the speech itself. Trump spent a good chunk of the speech reciting impressive-sounding economic statistics, and other parts handing out money and awards to individuals and causes that make him look good to various parts of the electorate. He took a number of swipes at socialism in various forms, an unsubtle signal as to how he plans to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders in the quite plausible event he’ll be the Democratic presidential nominee.\n",
            "In some ways, it was surprising in its restraint — there was not one mention of the Iowa caucus debacle or his imminent acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. In other ways, it was an unrestrained expression of Trump’s game-show presidency (more on that below). It was low-key by Trump standards for the most part but also contained some truly ugly moments.\n",
            "What follows is our sense of the highs and the lows, who (and what) came out looking better by the end of the night — and who (or what) did not.\n",
            "If there is one theme that President Trump hammered hardest on Tuesday night, it is that the economy is great. That also happens to be true, which makes Trump’s address — the official kickoff to his reelection campaign — a success.\n",
            "In typical Trump faction, he sometimes overreached in the specifics. “In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce,” he told the assembled members of Congress. “In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.” The numbers here aren’t precisely apples to apples, but more to the point, what Trump is observing is that Barack Obama took office as the worst recession in a generation was worsening, whereas Trump took office as the economy is booming. That’s not solely Obama’s fault nor to Trump’s credit.\n",
            "But the state of the economy now is somewhat to Trump’s credit, and some of his more ambitious brags fit the data. He really does have the lowest average unemployment of any president since official record-keeping began under Eisenhower (though he did lie and say “in the history of our country”):\n",
            "Trump is correct that he has the lowest average monthly unemployment rate on record, through this point in a presidential term, but the record goes back to the Eisenhower administration, not the history of the country. pic.twitter.com/Z3NWT1WzEs\n",
            "Nor is this merely dumb luck. Trump, despite tremendous criticism for violating norms around Fed independence, has consistently pressured his Fed chair, Jay Powell, to lower rates and keep them low to enable the unemployment rate to stay low and the workforce to grow.\n",
            "That, plus the fiscal stimulus of Trump’s tax cuts, has combined to juice the economy considerably. It’s not an accident: It’s deliberate policy, and, at least in the case of the Fed, it’s good policy.\n",
            "This success means very good things for his reelection odds. Decades of political science work on election forecasting implies that presidents running for reelection enjoy an incumbency advantage, that a strong economy helps the incumbent’s party, and that high levels of US military fatalities hurt the incumbent’s party.\n",
            "Trump is the incumbent, the economy is growing while unemployment stays very low, and despite some close calls, he hasn’t started new wars or expanded existing ones in ways that kill a lot of US service members.\n",
            "So his State of the Union was a reminder that he has engineered fundamentals that mark him as the clear favorite as we head to November.\n",
            "—Dylan Matthews\n",
            "This one is a bit complicated. On the one hand, socialism really did come in for a lambasting in Trump’s address — a theme personified by the appearance of special guest Juan Guaidó, the young Venezuelan opposition leader/president-in-exile who challenged Nicolás Maduro, the country’s socialist dictator. There are few ways to discredit socialism more effectively than by connecting it to Venezuela’s humanitarian catastrophe.\n",
            "On the other hand, there’s a case to be made that socialism came out ahead on this night. It is perhaps the greatest sign of the American socialist movement’s recent success that the incumbent president felt it necessary to spend much of his annual address to the nation condemning the ideology.\n",
            "Socialism has become increasingly popular with younger Americans, as seen in the rise of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You could argue that the socialists are not on the fringes anymore, they are winning converts, and you can see the results in Trump’s anti-socialist rhetoric.\n",
            "Indeed, much of the rhetoric wouldn’t feel out of place in a speech by Ohio Republican Sen. Robert Taft from 1950. “One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans,” Trump declared, wielding the s-word in an effort to discredit Medicare-for-all. “To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!”\n",
            "That said, connecting Venezuelan socialism to American socialism was a more effective rhetorical device than the old-and-busted “socialized medicine” routine. Who knows if it will actually prove effective with voters, but it’s an anti-socialist barrage that stood out.\n",
            "—DM\n",
            "If in 2014, I told you that the host of Celebrity Apprentice, also known for a key guest appearance in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, was running for president, and I asked you to imagine what an out-of-control game show host would do once in power, you would probably say something like “use the State of the Union for weird stunt surprises that shock and thrill the audience.”\n",
            "And, my god, did that manic game show host deliver.\n",
            "Tuesday night did not only feature the surprise awarding of a Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh (Rush Limbaugh!), right in the middle of the speech, by the first lady, but it involved the most Oprah-esque segment of any presidential speech in memory: After praising North Carolina mother Amy Williams, who “works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families … while her husband, Sgt. First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East,” Trump … revealed Sgt. First Class Townsend Williams.\n",
            "That’s right. In the middle of the speech, he surprised a military spouse by bringing back her husband from a tour of duty, and had the whole nation watch their emotional reunion.\n",
            "This, as much as anything, is why Donald Trump is president. He may not be a great real estate investor or casino owner, but he is an incredible showman who knows how to pull off an emotionally powerful reality show segment. He also knows how to use those skills to whip up brutal prejudices and fear of outsiders, and he did that in spades on Tuesday night as well.\n",
            "But you cannot deny this skill of Trump’s, and the State of the Union provided one of the most vivid reminders to date of that skill’s power.\n",
            "—DM\n",
            "It’s a Trump speech, so you have to expect some anti-immigrant demagoguery. But the depths and ugliness of this speech’s treatment, and what it augured for Trump’s reelection campaign, bears special mention.\n",
            "The speech contained graphic descriptions of crimes allegedly committed by unauthorized immigrants, including one lengthy discussion of a “gruesome spree of deadly violence” committed by a “criminal alien” in California that Trump blamed on “an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants.”\n",
            "Not content to paint undocumented immigrants as murderers, the president also blamed them for human trafficking, drug smuggling, and sexual assault. To hear Trump tell it,  America’s crime problem is really an immigration problem — which, to be clear, is not true.\n",
            "But perhaps the most interesting part of Trump’s anti-immigrant tirade came during his discussion of health care — specifically, his attack on Medicare-for-all. Part of his argument against the bill was the classic “socialism is bad” stuff Dylan mentioned above. But the lengthier section attacked Sanders’s signature policy primarily as a giveaway to undocumented immigrants.\n",
            "“Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders,” Trump said. “These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration.”\n",
            "Trump’s argument reminds me of what scholars of European far-right parties call “welfare chauvinism”: the idea that the government ought to provide benefits to native-born citizens, but cannot and should not provide the same to foreigners within its borders because it’s too expensive and they simply don’t deserve it. Trump made this line of thinking fairly explicit in the speech.\n",
            "“If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left,” he said. “But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens!”\n",
            "This version of the argument could prove quite effective. Historically, anti-minority sentiment has been a powerful reason white voters opposed redistributive policy like welfare and food stamp expansion. This is how Trump thinks he can beat back a populist appeal from Democrats in November: by turning the battle over the welfare state into a part of the culture war.\n",
            "—Zack Beauchamp\n",
            "Back in fall 2018, conservative activist Candace Owens founded “Blexit” (black exit, like Brexit — get it?), a campaign to persuade African Americans to abandon the Democratic Party. Nobody took it very seriously at the time. And, indeed, many Trump-era efforts to court black voters have been so crass and inept as to seem more like trolling than electioneering.\n",
            "But the 2020 State of the Union address featured a fairly sustained and disciplined effort to pitch Trump to African American voters. He talked about the criminal justice reform bill he signed, highlighted a student who could benefit from a school voucher program he supports, recognized a veteran of the Tuskegee Airmen, and dwelled at length on positive labor market news for black workers.\n",
            "Trump is obviously going to lose the black vote in November, and lose it badly. But there is some method to the madness.\n",
            "As I’ve written before, black voters were a relative bright spot for the GOP amid the disastrous 2018 midterms. Democrat Stacey Abrams, an African American gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, did 4 percentage points better with white voters in Georgia than Hillary Clinton did two years earlier, but 4 percentage points worse with black ones. Head-to-head polling matchups also generally show Trump doing slightly better with African Americans than he did in 2016. This still involves losing black voters by lopsided margins, but every vote counts, and it makes sense for Trump to do what he can to exploit that opening.\n",
            "—Matt Yglesias\n",
            "Look, I get that Rush Limbaugh has a pretty advanced case of cancer. We’re not supposed to be mean to people under circumstances like those. But this is a man who has had a deeply pernicious influence on American discourse.\n",
            "Limbaugh once suggested that unauthorized immigrants were spreading sexually transmitted diseases. He claimed that “feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.” He renamed the NBA the “Thug Basketball Association” and asserted that “in Obama’s America, the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering.”\n",
            "This kind of ugliness — the race-baiting, the sexism, the xenophobia — is a mainstay of Limbaugh’s show. You’d think that such a record would disqualify him from any kind of celebration during a State of the Union, let alone receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n",
            "The fact that Limbaugh got it anyway is not just a personal victory for him — it’s a victory for the entire alternative right-wing media ecosystem he helped pioneer. It shows the degree to which talk-radio firebrands and Fox News hosts have become integrated into the Republican establishment, unofficial branches of the party that wield tremendous influence over its operations.\n",
            "It also shows the degree to which its moral counter-revolution — its constant pushback against the norms of tolerance and anti-discrimination that supposedly won out in the 1960s — has been successful. Limbaugh’s legacy will be not his own show, but a constellation of conservative pundits and personalities who have taken up similar messages and spread them in different ways. They are the people who helped lay the groundwork for Trump, priming the conservative base for the backlash politics that propelled him to the White House.\n",
            "So Limbaugh’s award, while on a certain level grotesque, is on another level deeply fitting — a capstone for the movement that made Trump possible.\n",

            "與大自然密不可分\n",
            "被問到他們會怎樣形容自己的音樂，Hugar 給予的答案並不只是一般在音樂串流平台中常見的形容詞。「通常別人會把我們的曲風定義為Neo-classical或 Post-rock，但我會形容Hugar的音樂與自然密不可分，」Bergur 說。他補充，冰島有很多自然景觀和現象，例如火山、海洋、大雪和地震等，所以大自然和瞬息萬變的天氣都是他們的創作靈感。他們認為，Hugar跟其他冰島音樂人與別不同的地方，就是他們著重自身與自然的關係。對他們來說，音樂製作的質素，比起大眾對樂隊曲風的標籤更為重要 。\n",

            "無心插柳柳成蔭\n",

            "「六年前音樂串流平台還未算很流行，」Pétur解釋﹐供免費下載是為了建立更廣的聽眾群。「加上我們最沒打算用音樂賺錢，所以何不一試？」Bergur補充，反而最初最想聽聽大家對Hugar 音樂的評價，再見步行步。\n",
            "幸好，耐性等到接踵而來的好評。「樂迷開始下載專輯聽，我們亦收到愈來愈多的電郵，邀請我們到歐洲不同國家演出，」Pétur說。最初即興錄製專輯，三年後為他們帶來歐洲巡演的機會，還令二人找到現在Sony Music 的經理人﹐並開始活躍於各大型音樂節，包括冰島「電波音樂節」(Iceland Airwaves Music Festival)。\n",

            "最後Pétur寄語香港音樂同業，不只心想，還需付諸實行。「事情不用百分百準備好……很多人就是因為這個想法，從來沒有給人看過自己做的事，」Pétur解釋。「但同時要有耐性，」Bergur補充，「就像行樓梯似的一步一步來，卻速則不達啊。」就看著這兩位旅人，如何沿着自己的堆砌的varða，一步一步繼續這趟無止境的音樂之旅。\n",

            "一次讀書「失利」，或許讓她建築夢碎，但卻讓她尋回讀書的意義。「中六開始修讀心理學，一開始好像是被逼，但料想不到一讀就愛上。我是一個 over-sensitive 的人，有好也有不好處，有時會想太多。（我會想）為何會發生這件事，為甚麼人會這樣做。這就是心理學，the scientific study of human mind and behaviours。」她一口氣道出人生其中一個重要轉捩點。年代或遠去，記憶卻鮮明。\n",

            "同樣跨過語言藩籬的樂團還有大象體操。他們曾在臉書粉絲專頁公佈 2019 年的演出紀錄共 60 多場，泰半都在海外。\b精湛的演奏實力不僅風靡外國聽眾，他們也受邀至知名饒舌歌手 Tyler, the Creator 舉辦的 Camp Flog Gnaw 音樂節。值得一提的是，在 2020 年結束完售三場日本巡演後，大象體操更宣布鼓手嘉欽受邀為日本爵士鼓 Bonny Drums 代言；貝斯手凱婷亦成為 Fender Japan 的代言人。\n",

            "說到放棄行醫而跑去「惹事生非」的人，中國倒有兩個很有名的：一位叫周樹人，一位叫孫文。魯迅先生棄醫從文，因為他發現醫治國民的身體，遠不及醫治國民那麻木不仁的扭曲心靈來得重要。他以文字揭示社會的黑暗面、暴露民族的劣根性，以強國今天的尺度，算是幹了不少「傷害人民感情」的事。孫中山先生雖以第一名畢業於西醫書院，卻在行醫的掩護下發展革命事業。他不只勾結外國勢力，還學人搞軍火、做暴徒，用「極端手段」把執政政府推翻。做個猜想，如果者兩位偉大的「滋事分子」活於太平盛世，倒可能真的會安安分分，一輩子做個懸壺濟世的仁醫。但偏偏他們的世代碰上腐敗的政府和扭曲的社會，驅使他們拋開醫者的光環，走上「惹事生非」之路。\n",
            "醫護的職責是救急扶危，有崇高的道德地位。但人的道德價值和行事的意義，又是否可以單用一個專業守則來局限？當然，兩位偉人放棄行醫而轉投文化與革命事業，和今天醫護罷工對病人的直接影響有很大的不同。但其背景與初心卻如出一轍 — 當助人的初心遇上扭曲的制度，唯有尋求醫療以外的方式來保護人民。與其勸他們勿忘初心，還不如與他們一起挑戰那反智和扭曲的制度。\n",
            "其實發起罷工的工會指出，如果出現社區爆發會考慮擱置罷工，充分反映他們保護香港人的初心。他們願意賭上前途為我們的福祉罷工，又願意在需要時回來照顧我們。有這樣一群「惹事生非」的醫護人員，也許是香港人幾生修到的福氣。祝大家好人一世平安！\n",

            "我的博士論文算是研究「公眾恐慌」，現作 5 點分享。\n",
            "1. Public fear 的研究，大約可以區分為兩種研究：第一種，傾向是批判大眾非理性（或愚昧），研究者站在「理性」的位置，分析非理性的恐懼如何形成。著名的有 Gustave Le Bon 說的 crowd psychology，甚至因為美國反恐戰下經常透過激發大眾的恐懼來 justify 戰爭，這些都有超多研究。在這些研究中，fear is an ideology，一種虛假意識形態，它被當成一種知識和語言去理解，進行話語分析就完成了。例如，有很多研究已解說了美國政府如何把共產國家建構成妖魔。\n",
            "2. 第二種，是把 fear 當成情動（affective）的現象，就是典型地「不只談論語言／文本」，而是嘗試進入更複雜的處境。有一些社會學和人類學家會細心理解 fear 的形成，例如涉及了什麼 memory、myth、institution 及 geopolitical 的因素。這些研究是近 5-10 年才出現。近年最重要一本研究蒙古人的恐中症（sinophobia）的著作，一位柏克萊的人類學家 Franck Bille 分析了蒙古近年為何恐中。根據 Bille，中國學者往往指「因為中國冒起了，蒙古人自卑」，但他的 fieldwork 就分析蒙古恐中，跟中國本身 50 年代起的暴力事件及俄羅斯看輕中國（而被蒙古人內化）有關，而蒙古人又會因而針對國內的中國移民（這些「中國人」，甚至不是中國人，而其實是本土蒙古人的性小眾）。蒙古的例子可以啟發香港，但香港又有很多其他的獨特之處。\n",
            "3. 有關現時香港的恐懼，我覺得社會學家 Mabel Berezin 最有啟發性，因為她把 fear 連結到 border — 邊界不穩，因而無法排除威脅物，是大眾恐慌的主因。她研究了歐洲現代民族國家成形的過程，提出了此說法：共同體如何生產出互信和友愛？不是憑空便做到的，而是因為有 border 把 threat 中介了，使邊界內的人有安全感，便有溝通的可能，然後有 trust 甚至 fraternity。邊界是什麼？有值得信任的體制，有警察確保（邊界內的）秩序，而邊界外，有軍隊負責應對威脅物。Berezin 認為，如果沒有這些邊界，便出現 fear 和 hate。當然，她考究的是歐洲史，跟東亞和中國及香港的公眾情緒史都不同，但在理論上從 border 去解釋 fear，跟現時香港的情況很吻合 — 如果香港的體制和 border 是公眾可信，恐慌會大減（例如到澳門的程度），甚至很可能會有相應的 trust 和 empathy 產生出來。而對香港的 public 來說，state, police, army 甚至 head of government 都不屬於自己的。香港社會恐懼的，不僅僅是今年發生的流行病，也是整個應對的體制，人們認為體制是不公平地叫人去送死（所以，主權國家完全沒有醫護人員罷工情況）。\n",
            "4. 我對「恐慌」和「歧視」的關係很感興趣。我們知道，世界上有些地方開始因為恐懼武肺而「歧視」East Asian 和 Chinese。但香港的情況，還是很不同的。例如「餐廳歧視大陸人」其實跟 border 被控制，而且大量懷疑帶病者入關是有直接關係的。因為無法控制 border，民間要在自己附近的空間去劃界，在餐廳劃出自己的 border；這是民間的 production of border，跟現時大陸內部各地的情況很像。大陸農村把車放在路中心，不讓自己同胞回村，跟香港餐廳不讓大陸人進入，在我看來是相同的邏輯。究竟把這情況命名為「歧視」可以引出什麼思考方向，我未想到。\n",
            "5. 我對「歧視」沒有研究，我想用多點時間去看真正專家的 research。我覺得「公共理性」十分重要，但我們更要保持「研究心態」。例如，理解香港現時的 public fear，拿幾家餐廳在疫情爆發時期才貼出來的告示，去折射出「香港公共領域」的情況，就真是不太嚴謹。難道疫情完了，餐廳拿走告示，又要寫篇文說香港很「大愛」？又，一星期寫一次《蘋果》來聲稱自己「守住理性」，對於在近幾年為社會運動犧牲的人來說，又真是很難理解。再次，我期待更好的公共理性，不要把 self 當成 public，不要把跟自己不同的 public 當成 populist，要一起閱讀討論，一起進步。\n",

            "現在已算「戰時狀態」，應該將口罩這種戰略資源統合，由政府分配。還資本主義市場經濟？英美二戰時戰爭狀態，都會行蘇聯那套，因為戰爭期間，一定供不應求。\n",

            "政府絕對應該進行統合分配，現在是恐慌性需求，用市場力量，很難滿足，一個人有錢，可以一次過買夠一百盒，幾十個人，已經足夠清空一條街藥房的貨，恐懼下就是這樣。買夠就走，但多少為之「夠」？即使傳聞真有一億個存貨，也滿足不了市民的恐慌性搶購，不可能每個人都有足夠的，除非實名分配。\n",
            "增加產量，但也不是一時三刻可以提供「足夠」的，台灣政府增加六十條生產線，也要到月底，才可以將產能加到一日一千萬個。承接上面恐慌性需求，台灣是民主國家，人民對政府信任度較高，行政院多次發新聞稿有足夠口罩，也出現搶購潮，要限制購買量，香港不統合分配，絕不可能。\n",
            "我絕對相信資本主義市場經濟，在創造財富方面，比國家計劃出色，這是經過歷史驗證的事實，但不妨想想為什麼蘇聯，甚至美國，都要在戰時實行政府規劃？因為短期，我是指「短期」來說，除了解決上面恐慌性需求，亦可以統合到最多資源，與對手作戰略競爭，現在我們的「對手」，是疫情。當然，長期如此，一定仆街。統合分配口罩，不會是長期政策，除非疫情持續一年，但若果如此，相信我們會死清光。\n",

            "這讓我想起最近 HK01 的一篇報導〈食肆拒內地客學者批無助防疫 居港內地人理解但惋惜〉，我是其中一個受訪者。或許是由於我對文本的職業性敏感，最引起我注意的，是這篇報導中的話語是如何被表達和組織起來的。這當中引伸出一些我長久以來的觀察和思考。\n",
            "話語是被怎樣組織的\n",
            "對話語的分析，除了受訪者字面的意思，還可以包括話語的組織結構與模式。字面的意思反映的，往往是說話者經過選擇和組織之後想要呈現給外界的信息。那說話者是如何進行選擇和組織的呢？身處社會環境之中，我們都會去感知外界對我們說話的反應，於是會自覺不自覺地調整表達的方式，以使得自己想要傳達的訊息更容易被接納。因此，人們在選擇和組織話語的時候，會呈現出某種規律。這種規律或模式，反映的是說話者所感知到的外部環境與權力規則。這種模式在不同人身上重複，顯示這種對外部的感知不只是個人因素使然。也有的時候，受訪者的話語並非自發組織，而是通過提問者的提問結構與書寫記錄，被動地組織起來。這時候文字所反映還可能是：(1) 訪問者如何感知外界對該話題的反應；(2) 訪問者自身對該話題的態度。\n",
            "那麼這篇報導中的話語組織有怎樣的規律呢？這種規律又是否僅出現於這篇報導呢？\n",
            "每一個受訪的居港內地背景人士，對食肆拒絕接待普通話人士所表達的意見大致相似，概括來看包含以下元素：(A) 表達不同意；(B) 表達負面感受（遺憾、不舒服、沮喪等……）；(C) 表示可以理解，因為責任在政府。其中 A 和 B 是對店鋪公吿最直接的態度表達，C 卻不是，屬於補充的信息。A 和 B 都是在表達某種程度上的不認同與負面感受。C 則是在進行以下解釋：A 和 B 都不是在針對和苛責產生歧視行為的香港人，強調能夠理解歧視行為的出現，因為自己和出現歧視行為的人一樣都認為錯在政府。\n",
            "我們會發現 A 和 B 幾乎不會單獨存在，必然會使用「但是」之類的轉折語和 C 聯繫起來。有的時候，C 的篇幅遠超直接與事件相關的 A 和 B。並且，在 B 這個最直接關乎內心感受的類別，所有使用的詞彙都相當克制，沒有出現像「憤怒」這樣的強烈描述，也沒有抱怨、譴責之類較為強烈的情感表達。這一話語組織規律也不止出現於這篇報導，每當在反送中運動裡出現涉及地域身份偏見/歧視的情況，便可廣泛在支持運動的居港內地背景人士與香港友人的對話中觀察到（有興趣的朋友可以去留意一下）。有時更甚，連A和B都沒有，就直接進入 C，或是用 C 來自我否定 A 和 B 的必要性。這說明什麼呢？這說明說話者/書寫者感知到外界願意聆聽其感受的機會很低，並且已預期到外界會作出的負面回應，於是通過話語的組織以及表達的克制，來避免可能出現的反彈，安撫可能產生的牴觸，或消除相關的誤解，以使自身感受能夠最終被聽見（或是為了避免表達最真實的感受）。只是寫這段描述文字已經顯得囉嗦麻煩，就更不難想像在實際生活中時常要去這樣做是怎樣一種超額的精神負擔。\n",
            "歧視如何形成壓力\n",
            "在社會健康研究的領域，有一個關於小眾壓力的理論（Minority Stress Theory，來自 Ilan H. Meyer），講述的就是一個帶有污名的身份除了有可能引發直接的歧視事件，還意味著有此身份者需要長期消耗大量額外的精力來處理或避免歧視對自身帶來的影響，這當中包括用各種方法低調隱藏，處處小心謹慎以免成為目標，預期遭到拒絕而減少表達，內化這種歧視以致自我譴責⋯⋯正是這些長期而大量的額外消耗，累積起來形成小眾群體才不得不承受的精神壓力與健康風險。這個小眾壓力的概念是相當符合前面所述的受訪者/訪問者如何小心謹慎地組織話語的情景的，並且這絕不是一個只會在訪問過程中發生的情景。\n",
            "我們可以想像一下，是一個怎樣的外部社會環境，是一個怎樣的權力規則，使得受訪者（可能也包括訪問者）如此小心翼翼、如履薄冰地組織話語，為的僅僅是對一個顯然帶有歧視的行為表達自己的感受與不同意？而我們是否想要一個這樣的社會環境呢？這樣的社會環境真的只會影響到我們眼中的「他者」嗎？\n",
            "居港「大陸人」的日常困境\n",
            "面對直接針對性的歧視行為，作為一個受影響的個人，本應有充分的理由和權利去表達自己的感受。且這種感受，只要不是用仇恨的方式表達，無論強烈還是溫和，都理應得到尊重接納，並不需要以「證明自己對歧視者有充分的同理、對歷史政治社會背景有足夠的認知、對社會整體未來有積極期望和貢獻」為前提。然而事實是，一個居港內地人士如果希望自己的不公遭遇被聽見而不遭到誤解、否定甚至攻擊，需要首先說一口流利的粵語，然後在歷史知識、政治觀察和社會理論水平上都達到遠超平均的程度，最後在自我情感觀照上達到慈悲為懷、近乎無我的境界，他/她才有資格把這件事講出來。哪怕是這樣，在放下了自己、謹慎組織了盡可能溫和的話語之後，仍然會被解讀成是在「苛責」、「怪罪」香港人，在用「道德高地」吹毛求疵，在不識大體不為大局。對此他/她仍然需要將自己的感受放在一邊，以最大的耐心和善意去諒解去消化。\n",
            "如此高難度的智力、情商與價值理念的三重挑戰，卻是一些居港內地人士的日常，尤其是那些支持抗爭運動的人 — 因為他們對香港的同理使得他們更不忍苛責，也更不想被誤解，但這不意味著感受就會消失，也不意味著可以欺騙自己沒有看見。當然不是每一個居港大陸人都必然如此，每個人有不同的能力去避免或者緩和困境，有的人甚至從來沒有親身面對過這個問題，但恐怕這不是一個微小到不值一提的事件。就這個群體對歧視表達的不滿，有些朋友急於用「你應該理解香港人」、「要怪就怪政府」、「這不是提這種事的適當時機」、「你知不知道香港人都經歷了什麼」、「誰叫你的同胞普遍素質那麼低」、「只要你沒有做錯事就不用太在意」來作出回應。或許這半年多來的激盪令人們一時忘記了，公義的可能性在於有人看見傷害並認同這是一種不公，無論是個人層面的不公還是制度層面的不公。歧視對人最大的消耗與傷害，往往不只在於歧視的事件本身，更是在於歧視的「難以言說」與他人的「拒絕看見」。並且，社會進一步要求你只可以「開闊的心胸」淡然接受這一切，這些超乎常人的標準卻不被同時應用於他人的身上。說到這裡，其實這樣的經歷並非僅限於居港「大陸人」。性暴力受害者、LGBT 群體、少數族裔……甚至是每一個為存在於香港社會的不公義而痛心疾首的人都應對此深有體會吧。然而是什麼讓本質相似的經歷無法產生共鳴與同理，無法減少受壓迫者內部的壓迫以讓更多人免於這種苦難呢？\n",
            "小眾與共同體的另類想像\n",
            "說回文首那位被獲得了良知的朋友的故事。如果說良知的作用就是時常善意地提醒一下我們，自己是否無意間傷害了他人 — 就好像《木偶奇遇記》裡那隻名叫 Jiminy 的蟋蟀，仙女讓他負責扮演小木偶 Pinocchio 的良心（conscience），時常提醒他不要走偏 — 那麼，像我們這樣的「大陸人」，恐怕並不是因為有了良知而成為了香港人，而是因為特殊的身份背景與經歷，在這個特殊的歷史時刻，我們剛好扮演了「香港」這個共同體的良知，就好像許多小眾群體（性小眾、障礙人士、少數族裔、性暴力幸存者……）在主流社會縱橫交織的體系盲點中所扮演的角色一樣。小眾並不在共同體邊緣或以外，小眾就是一種主體性的存在。我們在共同體內一同堅持、守望，提醒腳下的陷阱，也在其失足的時候與之一同經歷掙扎，並執著地想像著一個更能實踐民主與平等的共同體樣貌。\n",

            "藝術哲學 (philosophy of art) 是哲學的一個領域，在現代的學術討論中，常會以「美學 (aesthetics) 」一詞簡稱之。嚴格說來，兩者有所區別。狹義而言，美學研究的對象是美，而美不只出現在藝術作品之中，也可以在藝術領域之外尋得，例如自然環境或生物界。藝術哲學就只把藝術當作研究對象，討論關於藝術作品的哲學問題。然而，藝術作品不一定是美的，尤其在二十世紀之後，愈來愈多的藝術作品不再追求美感。事實上，在當代藝術哲學的重要論題中，雖然也有涉及美的討論，但比重不高。\n",
            "從歷史的進程來看，比較像是美學這個領域的討論重心，從美感逐漸轉移到了藝術。除非必要，哲學家一般不會特別去區分美學與藝術哲學這兩個詞；例如英語世界最有影響力的兩本美學期刊《美學與藝術批評期刊 (Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism) 》以及《英國美學期刊 (British Journal of Aesthetics) 》，在內容上討論的大多是藝術哲學而非狹義的美學，但在期刊命名都以「美學」一詞為主。\n",

            "Paisley Livingston, Art and Intention: A Philosophical Study, Oxford University Press, 2005\n",
            "Paisley Livingston 以治學嚴謹著稱，是藝術哲學的中堅份子。本書是一本真實意圖主義 (actual intentionalism) 的代表著作；簡單說，真實意圖主義主張詮釋作品時應該考慮作者意圖。這其實是哲學中的一個老議題：詮釋作品時我們是否該高喊「作者已死」進而「驅逐」作者？在此議題上，歐陸哲學家例如巴特 (Roland Barthes) 或傅柯 (Michel Foucault) 大多反對豎立作者的權威，也反對文本會有單一的意義。在（英美分析的）藝術哲學中正好相反，真實意圖主義一直佔據重要甚至主要的位置，Livingston這本書是一個很好的例子。然而，本書在內容上遠遠超出了詮釋理論的議題；可以說， Livingston 為了解決詮釋的問題，「順帶」也解決了圍繞在該議題周邊的其他議題。\n",
            "Livingston 的論述非常有系統，並且循序漸進。他首先花了一整章的篇幅討論意圖的本質。如果我們不能確定意圖到底是一種什麼樣的心靈狀態 (mental state) ，那後續對於意圖與詮釋的討論都不會有太大意義，而這點是許多藝術哲學家沒有深入處理的。本章引入了很多行動理論 (action theory) 的研究成果，可說是本書一大亮點。\n",
            "鋪墊好基礎後， Livingston 進一步釐清「作者 (author) 」的概念，並說明在處理文本同一性 (textual identity) 以及作品的版本 (version) 這些關於本體論的問題時，如能考慮作者的意圖，那也起到一定的作用。接著，他為真實意圖主義做辯護，提出了真實意圖主義的一種溫和版本，主張作者意圖只有在成功實現時才決定了文本的意義。最後，他用同樣的立場去解決虛構真理 (fictional truth) 的問題，一併檢討了 David Lewis 和 Gregory Currie 等人的理論，作為本書的延伸討論。\n",
            "本書除了議題安排上有層次、論述嚴謹精密之外，作者對於相關文獻的檢討相當全面且徹底，對於想要了解藝術與意圖之哲學問題的讀者來說，是一本重要的參考書。\n",

            "Noël Carroll, On Criticism, Routledge, 2009\n",
            "Noël Carroll 是當代一位非常重要的藝術哲學家。作為一位學者， Carroll 一個很大的特點是他的學術寫作極富大眾魅力。不管是學術論文還是專書，他都能夠用平易近人、趣味橫生的方式撰寫，又不失學術的專業與嚴謹。本書也是如此。\n",
            "在這本書中， Carroll 處理的是「評論哲學 (philosophy of criticism) 」或稱「後設評論 (meta-criticism) 」。簡單說，就是從後設的角度來探討藝術評論 (art criticism) 。此處的藝術泛指了各種創作類型，包括且不限於文學、戲劇、音樂以及視覺藝術。有作品就會有評論家，廣義的評論家可泛指一般讀者或觀眾，狹義的評論家則是專業評論者。不管是哪一種，只要針對作品提出看法，都會有評論的產生。\n",
            "Carroll 的目的不只是要提出一套關於評論的描述性說法（評論家實際上在做什麼），更重要的是他對於評論的規範性說法（評論家應該做什麼）。一般說來，評論有三個部份：對作品的描述 (description) 、詮釋 (interpretation) 以及評價 (evaluation) 。詮釋常被認為是評論的核心。不同於主流的看法， Carroll 一方面認為評價才是評論之中最重要的部份，應該要成為評論的首要目標；另一方面，他也認為對作品的評價主要奠基在作者是否成功實現自己的創作意圖。評論不能脫離對作者的考量而進行， Carroll 也因此認為他的看法是一種人文主義的 (humanistic) 評論觀，而這種評論觀是現今評論界十分欠缺的。\n",
            "最後， Carroll 反駁「所有的評論都不能有客觀性」這樣的看法。他認為有些評論是可以有客觀性的，尤其是當我們能夠確切辨識作品的類型時，這是因為類型本身既有的一些原則或標準可以成為判斷依據。\n",
            "哥倫比亞大學曾經做過一個統計，有百分之七十五的藝術評論家認為評價是評論中最不重要的部份。 Carroll 這本書挑戰主流看法，深刻探討了評論的本質與目的，值得推薦給對藝術評論感興趣者。\n",

            "人類跟其他動物的最大區別之一，就是人類具備說故事 (story-telling) 的能力。一則故事是一則敘事 (narrative) ，而敘事則預設了敘事者 (narrator) 。 Currie 從哲學角度探討了許許多多圍繞在敘事與敘事者的有趣問題，例如：什麼是敘事？如何理解一則敘事？敘事者與作者有什麼不同？如何用演化的角度來理解敘事觀點？如何理解反諷中的敘事觀點？本書的章節安排並非層層推進的結構性論述，而是各章分別處理不同的問題，但都緊扣敘事與敘事者的主題。\n",
            "Currie 提出的其中一個有趣論點是，敘事者與作者都是製造一則敘事的人，因此沒有差別；例如說華生醫生是福爾摩斯探案的敘事者，跟說他是福爾摩斯探案的作者並沒有差別，真正有差別的地方在於，華生醫生是內在 (internal) 的敘事者或作者，而非外在 (external) 的敘事者或作者。所謂內在／外在，指的是內在／外在於敘事中的虛構世界，因此華生是內在的敘事者（或作者），柯南‧道爾 (Conan Doyle) 則是外在的敘事者（或作者）。這裡的問題在於，小說中是否一定有一個內在的敘事者？例如以第三人稱全知觀點所敘述的故事（《三國演義》是一個例子），是否仍存在一個內在的敘事者？ Currie 提出了反對論證。\n",

            "演化美學的核心問題是：人類的審美行為以及藝術的創作與欣賞是否演化而來的？換句話說，這些行為是否能讓我們的祖先繁衍得更好？本書針對這個問題做了全面性的探討。\n",
            "在本書的第一部份， Davies 針對「美感 (the aesthetic) 」以及「藝術」這兩個概念做了分析，並闡述演化論的基本要義，接著再進一步論述演化與審美及藝術如何產生關聯。在第二部份， Davies 深入探討審美與演化的關聯，這部份涉及動物美學（人對動物的審美）、環境美學（人對自然環境的審美）以及人體美學（人對人體的審美）。第三部份是本書的重頭戲，探討三種藝術演化論：（一）藝術是演化的一種適應 (adaptation) ，也就是可以讓人類繁衍得更好的一種特質；（二）藝術是演化的副產品（by-product），是演化過程中無可避免的隨附物；（三）藝術是一種文化的產物，但與演化並非全無關聯，因為它必須仰賴在更廣泛的一些適應，例如智力與想像力。\n",
            "綜觀全書，Davies抱持懷疑論的態度，認為現有的證據都不足以將演化充分地連結到審美以及藝術。然而，這方面的研究並非毫無意義，因為它能幫助我們更加了解藝術在人性中扮演的角色。\n",
            "本書因為題材的關係，洋溢著科普讀物的趣味（但難度當然高上許多！），作者學識淵博、旁徵博引，令人大開眼界。想知道哲學如何與其他知識領域結合，便應該閱讀這本書。\n",

            "\n",
            "Alan H. Goldman, Philosophy and the Novel, Oxford University Press, 2013\n",
            "我們常會聽到人們說某部作品文學性很高，或者是某部作品文學性不夠；如果後者剛好是你喜歡的作品，你要如何捍衛它的價值？這其實回歸到一個很困難也很少有人可以說清楚的哲學問題：文學價值 (literary value) 是什麼？ Goldman 在這本書正面迎戰這個問題，但他的野心其實更大。\n",
            "Goldman提出了一套很有說服力的價值理論，用來幫助我們評估文學價值的高低。簡單說，一部作品的價值來自於該作品能讓讀者在不同面向同時投入的程度，這四個面向包括認知 (cognition) 、想像 (imagination) 、情感 (emotion) 以及知覺 (perception) 。只要在這四個面向能夠讓讀者高度投入的作品，就是好作品。換句話說， Goldman 將文學價值定義為「作品能讓讀者心智能力多方運轉的程度」。因此，價值的高低並非取決於作品是否為純文學或大眾小說。 Goldman 特別花費本書中一章的篇幅來論證神秘小說（mystery, 台灣常常譯為「推理小說」）因其特殊的寫作目的、形式與結構，可以滿足上述條件，常常具備高度文學價值。\n",
            "Goldman 進一步說明這套價值理論與詮釋的關聯。他認為合理的詮釋就是不與文本牴觸的詮釋，按照這個條件，一個文本可以有多於一個的合理詮釋，哪怕是互相衝突的詮釋，只要不與文本牴觸便可以。不過，這還不是詮釋的終點，我們應該進一步從這些合理詮釋中挑選出那些能盡量提高作品價值的詮釋，這時前述的價值理論便派上用場。也就是說， Goldman 的詮釋理論是客觀性條件（文本限制）與規範性條件（價值高低）的綜合。該理論被稱為「價值最大化理論（the value maximizing theory）」。\n",
            "本書的精彩之處就在於，前半部談理論，後半部進行「實作演示」。 Goldman 遵循了自己的價值與詮釋理論，依序評論了四本經典小說：《傲慢與偏見 (Pride and Prejudice) 》、《頑童歷險記 (Huckleberry Finn) 》、《心塵往事 (The Cider House Rules) 》以及《諾斯托羅莫 (Nostromo) 》。 Goldman 這本書從理論到實作一氣呵成，說明了哲學家並非光說不練、紙上談兵，而是能真正將理論應用，可說是少數結合理論與實作的哲學著作。\n",

            "眾所周知，澳門的民主力量薄弱，一來是因為《澳門特別行政區基本法》的沒有承諾「雙普選」（關於特首選舉辦法的第四十七條及立法會議員選舉辦法的第六十八條），二來親中勢力在澳門主導社會發展、坐擁豐富資源，在 80 年代才開始發展的民主派無法對抗。在 2017 年的澳門立法會選舉中，民主派在 33 個議席中只奪得可憐的三席。澳門的親中勢力在 70 年代開始就相當鞏固，轉捩點是 1966 年的「一二三事件」。在 66 年的警民衝突中，澳葡政府無力壓制示威，最後在 67 年初簽署《澳門政府對華人各界代表所提出的抗議書的答覆》，基本上確認中國在澳門的主權，將親台力量驅逐，親中勢力自此透過大量社團根紮澳門。這種做法與港英政府的「行政吸納政治」有異曲同工之處，但澳門更大規模地推行這種社團政治，在 2016 年時，澳門的社團數目已經有近八千個，但其人口卻只有約五十五萬。中共利用資源影響社團，讓這些社團成為「恩庇式社團」，以維隱而非上達民意為目標，最後淪為維穩工具，由 70 年代開始影響澳門人的政治參與。\n",

            "但是，假若沒有工會或者工會根本沒有行動，一般打工仔可以因為疫情而拒絕工作嗎？舉個例子，假如無良僱主這個時候仍叫僱員去湖北談生意；合約清潔工被要求在缺乏保護裝備的情況下消毒確診者的住所；林鄭要求公務員上班「戴咗都要除返」口罩，這個時候作為僱員的你可以怎麼辦？\n",
            "加拿大、英國4、以及美國的法律均明文訂明在面對緊急和嚴重的危險，如果僱員真誠和合理地認為自己的健康受到威脅，可以合法地拒絕工作。可是，香港法例並沒有明文賦予僱員這樣的權利。\n",
            "根據 《職業安全及健康條例》第6條，「每名僱主均須在合理地切實可行範圍內，確保其所有在工作中的僱員的安全及健康」。如果僱主沒有採取合理的措施，保障僱員的健康，僱主即屬違法。勞工處可以執法，一經定罪，僱主可被罰款$200,000及監禁6個月。但是，要靠勞工處控告僱主可以說是漫長的等待，到疫情退卻很可能仍沒有行動。而假若你的僱主剛好就是政府，那麼勞工處採取行動的機會更加渺茫。即便勞工處最終採取行動，僱主被判罰款，對於真的因為工作環境的保護不足而不幸患上WARS的僱員來說又有什麼作用？\n",
            "但縱使法律沒有明文賦予醫護以致一般打工仔在危險時拒絕工作的權利，難道面對生命受到嚴重威脅，我們仍然要對僱主唯命是從？筆者認為香港法庭有法律基礎，也應該賦予僱員拒絕危險工作。\n",
            "第一、在國際法下，香港政府有責任保障僱員拒絕危險工作的權利。國際勞工組織的《職業安全和衛生及工作環境公約》第十三條訂明僱員如果因為工作情況出現對生命健康有緊迫嚴重的威脅而拒絕工作，政府有責任保護他們免受不當的處理。縱使此公約目前並不適用於香港，但公約有超過59個締約國（當中包括中國），而全球４２個國家賦予勞工在危險時拒絕工作的權利。僱員拒絕危險工作作為基本人權之一，香港政府有責任履行國際法之下的責任，保障醫護、以及所有僱員的安全，無需要在危險和健康受威脅的環境下工作。\n",
            "第二、美國的案例可以作為參考，作為僱員拒絕工作的法律基礎。在Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshal一案中，當時的美國法律仍沒有明文賦予僱員拒絕危險工作的權利，但美國政府的守則卻只僱員有這樣的權利，因此有僱主挑戰這個守則的合法性，認為僱員拒絕工作的條例超出條例的權限。美國最高法院審視當時的職業安全及健康條例，指出縱使法例沒有明文賦予勞工這個權利，立法的原意和框架顯示勞工不需要單靠法例所明文提供方法來保障自己，在法律沒有提供足夠保障時，勞工可以選擇拒絕工作。香港法庭可以應用同樣的邏輯：縱使《職業安全及健康條例》沒有明文賦予僱員拒絕工作的權利，但僱員在面對嚴重和迫切的危險時，不需要單靠勞工處的執法，可以主動拒絕工作，直至有關的威脅被解除。\n",
            "香港的法律目前對於僱員是否可以在危險時拒絕工作仍有一定不確定性，政府應該考慮效法加拿大、美國、英國明文立法賦予僱員這個權利。但是，面對迫在眉睫的疫情，筆者相信香港人仍可以在法律框架下自救。\n",

            "順帶一提，有人問「發國難財」是不是市場經濟？政府應不應干預？價格是市場信號，若一種商品的需求上升，而供應跟不上，價格則會上升。價格上升令更多的廠商投入生產，從而令市場達到均衡狀態。\n",
            "但是關於搶購口罩，有三點值得注意。第一，在疫症蔓延時，若口罩是保障生命安全的基本工具，政府有義務解決市民基本生存需要。第二，口罩除了減少其他人把病菌傳染給自己，也減少自己把病毒傳染給其他人，所以有界外效應，在疫症時效應特別大，確保每人都有口罩很重要，完全依賴市場分配，並不是最好。第三，在公眾陷入恐慌的極端情况，市場失靈，價格信號起不到作用，需要政府維持秩序。情况類似金融風暴時政府救市來抗衡恐慌性拋售。\n",

            "中國官方法學者田飛龍近日批評，香港和台灣政府防治武漢病毒的措施，是「狹隘的地方主義及政治本土化」、「道德衰退」等等。在香港看來，這種局勢研判折射出天朝和小國之間，處於完全不同的時間維度。\n",
            "田批評台灣禁止口罩出口、香港一定程度截斷自由行加上醫療界罷工等事件，是「過度偏重地方利益而損及國家利益與同胞情感」，這實在是充滿天朝的自我中心。港台等地與中國從來就不在一個價值體系之中，也不覺得同心同德，不形成一個有機的「中國共同體」，台灣政府的權力是通過二千三百萬人參與的選舉來賦權，在倫理上政府決策必以保境安民為生，服務台灣共同體是義務，其他則不是，此誠現代政治理念加上現實形勢的必然結果。\n",
            "田的批評是以中國的大義出發，以無機的中國共同體發旨，批判港台自行其是、指控其他政府履行對人民保護義務，是出賣中國共同體，但其實港台人的大多數根本不認同所謂的中國共同體。這是一以理限事、單邊認識世界的自我中心。就像乾隆皇帝視英國使節為朝貢者的自我幻影投射，將自己的價值系統投射為東亞的「普世價值」，要求所有地區都跟從。這是政治現實，即使是強國也不能勉強，就像大清可以相信所有外國都是朝貢者，但渾然不覺自己已進入世界秩序的深水之中。\n",
            "更別說，在香港人眼中，林鄭政府根本是顧及北京和所謂的中國人感受，而遲遲不封關，任由大規模人口流動持續，疫情終於在本地爆發，但在北京御用學者眼中，卻仍然是「本位意識」，不夠顧及中國。可見兩個意識的時間維度差天共地。在經典和理論上的天朝意識，天朝無求於小國，但在現實中，卻是一種無止境的勒索關係。林鄭已親共愛黨若此，善男順女的香港人仍停留在冷嘲熱諷而沒有大規模排華，仍被天朝視為不忠、沒有出力幫忙，那麼可以想像，即使林鄭做得更過份，天朝人還是會批評「港台」這個概念。\n",
            "因為港台永遠都做不夠，對中國存在永遠的虧欠。論理上對中國人來說，港台是抵拒融合的叛民，所以無論如何都處於道德低地，根本無關具體來說港台如何應對。相反，上海也有人拒絕與武漢人同機，與漢武接壤的省市有民兵持械把守邊界，也是十足自保和地方主義，但天朝輿論只會高規格大動作批評港台之類 ，可見有關批評無關具體行為。反而是先射箭後劃靶。我們的歷史、利益、立場、傳統，全部都是對方的「批判資源」。\n",
            "令人想到在香港回歸前夕曾經有過的討論：香港即使回歸中國，中國一方面會視香港為中國性不足、正統以外的異類，而香港自身自我認知為中國性不足（鄉愁），也會促使他們進行精衛填海式的歸化，彌補自身不足的中國性，但最後還是會發現雙方的鴻溝大到不能視為一體。未回歸的時候，我們是避過了「中華民族共同災難」的「逃兵」，回歸了，我們仍是被視為高傲自峙的自守者；要民主則是威脅國家安全，正常的行政長官候選人永遠得不到北京信任。\n",
            "然而「盤古初開」以來，香港人根本異常熱衷支援革命、救災、希望工程諸如此類，但即使做了那麼多，香港人仍然不會得到中國人的信任，低下階層來到香港，仍是敵意極深：香港是中國的！沒有中央照顧你們完蛋了。這是一個永遠無法填補的黑洞，香港人做再多都不會是中國的原生部份，所以慢慢地很多人開始發現「補償自身的中國性」是個不可能的任務，所以 why bother，他們就漸漸甩開幻象，回歸本土，就像中國統治之下的所有地區，實際上都以自己的利益至上，大國是虛無，地方才是真實。就像上面說到的上海人。\n",
            "而香港人最勇敢的一群的勇敢之處，在於他們明白自己處於「中國鏈」的道德低點，任何動作都會惹來中國的大格局批判，但還是沒有放棄爭取自己的利益，不管是掃除走私、保衛資源、要求民主，乃至重新挖掘出自己的獨立自決權，這些其實並非香港人「激進化」，而是重新挖掘出自己的命運共同體，創造出第一代的保守主義。他們對中國的看法，已經不如司徒華那一代的中國愛國者。近世港人的中國觀，已經洗盡鉛華，不覺得自己是高等華人，亦不認為自己有道德責任去拯救中國，也沒有北上將中國改造成香港的大香港狂想，這一切是「建設民主中國」崩潰至今的自然結果。\n",
            "不是熱情也不是冷酷，而是如實觀照。這是最健康的中國觀，當然這是將中國視為他者了，在中國眼中便是分離，然而這對香港來說卻是由無明進入清明。\n",
            "中國的歷史意識就是永不反省，由 19 世妃以來，這是連續的。鴉片戰爭其實有大清抵拒已經君臨的世界貿易秩序，對外交形勢一無所知而導致，「鴉片」只是政治張力下的導火線；八國聯軍中的「義和團」亦同理，是大清潛意識對整個「現代」一種反動的攻擊。中國一直視自己為天下間最慘的受害者，所以只會檢討別人而鮮有檢討自己。\n",
            "在批評（主要是）台灣等地對自己的「克制」反應，甚至要反省自己對別人恩將仇報已久。業力爆破只是剛好。台灣以前也幫過中國抗疫，換來的是在國際層面繼續打壓，不准台灣進入世界衛生組織，令台灣暴露於更高的疫情風險。香港亦是同理，03 年沙士是中國惹進來的，田文認為自由行是香港要求的恩賜，但這根本搞錯，自由行在香港根本不受歡迎，而那更加是一個中國控制香港經濟、令全香港旅遊區化的經濟殖民陰謀，但在他們的自我認知，卻認為是一個恩賜﹗但如果不是中國搞出了沙士，還傳染進來，香港根本不需要這些「救助」。\n",
            "田文所折射出的中國意識，是一個丁蟹化的集體，他不斷追殺藍潔瑛一家，但最後卻說：「我這半生，就是被情義兩個字累死」、「原來你一直真心喜歡方進新，你為什麼不早說呢？」、「我殺了人，但我無罪啊」— 那是個一秒都沒有自我反省的角色，正如中國。為甚麼中國還在說魯迅，因為那種入骨的反省，到魯迅就沒了。\n",
            "田一大輪批評香港的本土主義傾向，但又說中國經濟「持續成長及對港台的整合壓力」，導致香港人對中國出現了「幽怨心態」，這又回到了嬰兒潮一代在中國經濟落後時在中國作威作福、養二奶的問題，的確很討人厭。然而那些上一代也是大中華的，也非積極求變者。\n",
            "對中國統治作出積極反應的人，例如在 2014 至 2019 年的幾波青年，很多根本未經歷過中國落後的歲月，他們也從未歧視過中國，他們一出生就面對作為天朝帝國的中國。本土青年當然主導並輻射力強大，特別是在「建設民主中國」毀滅之後的意識形態真空，然而他們的心態不是「幽怨」，而是出現搏奕心態，並充滿存亡的焦慮感和危機感，因為自己的制度和文化將會被「整合」而毀滅。\n",
            "中國人似乎仍未願意搞清楚是誰在發動香港的革命，反而將不革命者的性格張冠李戴，用來解釋港人對中國體制的成因。最後田傲慢地表示，港台等小國不臣服中國，就會與全球化脫軌，似乎在中國的自我意識中，自己已經等同了全球化。這是一個古老天朝概念的輪迴，在 19 世紀之前，中國統治者認為自己擁有天下，而自己就是國際。\n",
            "然而港台早就離開了「國際就是好」後進階段，在觀念上反而是因為前進而回歸到自我意識和共同體建設，正如范瑋琪為自己親中辯護，說自己是 globalist，反而被笑多兩錢重。中國是想爭取民心的，但他們的識見令他們認為，全球化就是好。這套推銷給第三世界國家，也許奏效，但香港早就經歷過全球化了，也開始認識到所謂全球化的短處和陰暗之處。\n",
            "中國認為，小國根據民主原則自保、不向中國自我犧牲朝貢，就是狹隘的地方主義，是「新一輪全球化大局的價值短板」，這只是小眉小眼的帝國暴發戶想法。因為香港不認為民主和「特定政府服務特定人民」是缺憾，反而是天地之常經，國家首先如此組成，才有健康的「國際社會」。中國所說的全球化，其實就是「克服」主權國家秩序，令全球慢慢變成以中國為宗主的朝貢秩序。在這個願景下，連國家擁有主權，都是「中華型全球化」所不悅。習在黨內的集權、中國對香港「一國兩制」的權力徵收，就是將來要改變其他主權國家的路徑和預演。\n",
            "中國否認自己是世界秩序的挑戰，希望避免哈米吉多頓式文明大戰，不想落入希臘城邦 vs 波斯帝國的二元論大戰，但看體制中人的思路和寫作，還是脫不了古老的華夷之別。華夷觀念者，認為自己是華，所以是有責任以華變夷，對現代中國來說，他們認為主權國家秩序，是對宇宙的完美狀態的侵蝕，他們認為「盛世」是回到中國還是霸權的時代，即所有地方都不是主權國家，都是由天朝所統領的「邦國」。所以中國最終還是會不由自主地成為美國和整個世界的挑戰者，中國將會重覆日本軍國主義者的路徑，視與西方衝突為「尊王攘夷」，在爭取「東方王道帝國」復興的期待之下，迎來非常嚴重的哈米吉多頓挫敗。\n",
            "中華帝國主義者是末日教派的精緻形式，但他們都期待一個克服現世（美帝秩序）的「新天新地」，但在每次橫渡彼岸的時候，他們都會迎來自己的毀滅。\n",

            "先說明一下，最新這次調查是在一月中旬進行，也就是武漢肺炎全面爆發之前。好感度淨值的意思是表示好感的百分比減去表示反感的百分比。由於樣本只有五百個左右，所以誤差比較大，淨值誤差在 95% 置信範圍內是 7%，所以輕微的數據改變可以只是出於抽樣誤差。\n",
            "我們看一看結果。首先是中港台澳。香港人對香港政府的反感度大幅增加，這點應該不意外，也和其他相關的民意調查結果一樣。香港人對中國政府的反感度也增加了，但幅度較細，不過我懷疑這數據在武漢肺炎全面爆發後可能已改變。\n",
            "香港人繼續十分喜愛台灣政府，至今台灣政府在香港人的心目中的地位已是調查範圍內的第一名。注意這其實是相對新的現象。回到 2017 年和 2018 年的時候，香港人對台灣政府的好感度其實並不明顯。\n",
            "香港人對澳門政府的好感度在過去半年大幅下降。一個可能的解釋是和反送中運動有關，香港人因為害怕失去自由，便對控制較嚴的澳門政治特別敏感，而澳門政府拒絕一些香港人入境的做法對此恐怕也沒有太大幫助。當然，過去數天澳門政府在處理武漢肺炎時明顯比香港政府主動，如果現在重做這個調查的話可能結果會不太一樣。\n",
            "再看世界各地。香港人對日本政府的好感度持續上升。這同樣是一個新現象，過去香港人對日本政府的態度曾經是負面的，2017 年時的淨值是 -18%，現在升至 +29%，也就是兩年半內有 47 個百分點的增幅，日本駐港總領事館應該加人工了吧？後面是什麼原因？我沒有很好的解釋，但這絕對是一個值得深入研究的題目。\n",
            "香港人對美國政府的好感度大幅改善，淨值由 -24% 升到 -2%。雖然仍然是負數，但比起 2018 年的 -41% 同樣是極大升幅。最有可能的解釋，應該是《香港人權及民主法》的通過，讓香港人有機會經歷一次美國民主政制的運作，從而有所改觀。\n",
            "香港人對英國政府的好感度淨值跌至 +19%，雖然仍然是正數，卻是 2014 年以來的最低點。對於英國政府，在過去半年，我想很多香港人都會想說：「誰人待我好、待我差、太清楚」。\n",

            "林鄭及其政府口說會對醫療衛生隊伍作無限量的支持，但實際上卻是對處於防疫前線的工作人員安危於不顧。政府可以額外多花超過 10 億元來讓黑警繼續胡作非為違法違紀打人，但除了早前削減了那 2.5 億醫療開支之外，政府及建制派一再抽起為兩所大學醫療研究向立法會申請的撥款，其實都是針對醫療界及大專教育界對逆權抗爭的支持而作出的報復。現在那一個不湯不水的所謂局部封關措施，根本仍然是置前綫醫療隊伍於一個無法預計的衛生風險前緣。\n",

            "前六個月，「民族主義者」們的禍害雖然也可見，無論是在香港和大陸他們都有著一定程度的聲勢；但他們的可怕之處，卻是到了最近這個月疫症爆發後，才真正發揮得淋漓盡致。這場疫災原本正正是對「政治不關我事」的最佳駁斥，上述三種人中的頭兩種當中，有不少人即使面對「失控警暴和警權無限大」都依然還沒覺醒，但面對人禍所致的疫災，也不得不開始面對一點點現實而有所動搖，可是「民族主義者」們卻依然是死性不改 — 不單只一直不正視疫症爆發其實要歸疚於極權政體中的貪腐和上瞞下欺這事實，更順著極權政府所散播的「風向」把正常和正當的防疫措拖扭曲成「不愛國不愛同胞」而加以責備，這種人當中有不少至今竟還會盲目地說疫情其實不嚴重，說一切都只是想謀害中國/大中華民族的陰謀家所誇大虛構的謠言，說什麼美國其實也有流感，又或者說病毒其實是外國故意弄到中國去的，諸如此類。此中的愚昧無知和宗教式狂熱實在令人大開眼界和心寒。\n",
            "早前 70 周年國慶之時，大陸的「朋友圈」除了充斥著種種看到國產的東風核彈而感動流涕大喊「祖國媽媽我愛你」和「我和我的祖國，一刻也不能分割」等的異常亢奮之外，還流傳著一輯非常病態的漫畫，以一個小孩自小被欺凌卻發奮堅持努力最終出人頭地的狗血故事作開始，然後說這小孩就是「中國」，說「中國」過去多年來的貧苦艱難其實全因種種「外國勢力」欺凌阻礙所致，而「外國」之所以要聯手這樣做是因為心底害怕「中國」潛在的強大，而「中國」現在真克服了所有欺凌崛起來了……實在是由極端自卑反彈出病態自大和沒救的自欺欺人……三個多月後，疫症因貪腐隱瞞而大規模爆發成災，那些人似乎都沒很大的覺醒，同樣的思路和論調依然在重覆著，把問題全推卸到外國誇大陷害甚至蓄意加害而中國人卻始終在堅毅地創造奇蹟等等（當然國家宣傳機器有在帶風向，但不少民眾受落和深信才是問題癥結）。\n",
            "更令人心寒的是，這種民族主義的病毒不只影響著困在中國極權政體管治範圍的民眾，有不少這樣的民族主義病患其實是身在香港、台灣、東南亞的人，甚至是早已移民到了歐美澳加的華僑或一些海外唸書的留學生 — 也許只要自卑心還在，只要自立的主體性還沒能發展起來，即使離開了極權政體的管治，奴性和宗教式的國家狂熱始終難除。\n",
            "真正阻礙一個國家或社會進步或解放的，正正就是這種自卑又自大的民族主義和盲目的愛國主義，這場疫災所揭示的其實是更深層的病，即使魯迅百多年前早已對於此病作出吶喊，雖然過去一、二百年經歷了一場又一場「變革」、「革命」或「改革」，根本的問題依然沒變。如果人們、人本身一日不「覺醒」，那的確是絕望和希望皆為虛妄。\n",

            "Context: \n",
            "武漢肺炎至今已感染全球共 2 萬多人，至今 427 人死亡，727 人入院後康復。世界衛生組織較早前更將疫情宣佈為國際關注突發公共衛生事件，有機會向全球擴散。比起沙士疫情，新型冠狀病毒感染數據顯示其傳染力更強，科學家也未能確認到病毒的所有傳播途徑。要準確估計疫情發展則是言之尚早，但流行病學家已開始提出數個可能局面。\n",
            "最理想情況是疾病會如沙士般在一段時間後自然消失。\n",
            "埃默里大學 (Emory University) 全球衛生醫學教授 Jessica Fairley 向 Vox 指出， 2003–2004 年 SARS 疫情就是全球公共衛生措施可有效控制疫情的例證。當時旅遊限制及邊境檢疫政策有效減低了疫情擴散機會，而醫生對疾病敏感度增加、診斷技術改進，以及隔離病人治療等方法，都成功減低 SARS 疫情傳播風險。\n",
            "世界衛生組織緊急衛生總監、流行病學家 Mike Ryan 在 2 月 1 日接受美國醫療媒體 STAT 訪問時亦表示，有理由相信疫情可受控。原因包括：家居續發率 (secondary attack rate) 偏低；其次，醫護人員感染率也較 SARS 及 MERS 低，而中國旅客向海外傳播率也不高——截至 2 月 5 日，海外感染個案為 212 宗。\n",
            "不過要有效控制病毒傳播的其中一個關鍵，是疾病是否會有無明顯病徵的「隱形病人」出現。\n",
            "2004 年世衛發表的 SARS 檢討報告指出：「若 SARS 在病徵出現前已有傳播能力，疾病將難以、甚至無可能受控。」較早前刊於《新英格蘭期刊 (NEJM) 》研究指德國患者是遭隱形患者感染，但其後德國公共衛生機構 Robert Koch 研究所則指該研究有誤，暫未能證無病徵者可傳新型冠狀病毒。不過香港衛生署昨日 (4/2) 則指，現時已共有 4 宗個案均未能找到明顯病源，顯示本地可能出現隱形傳播。\n",
            "另一個關鍵是「超級帶菌者」。除非有超級帶菌者出現，SARS 一般較難以在醫療環境以外傳播。當時只有找到超級帶菌者，並將其隔離，已可大大減低疫情傳播能力。問題是科學家現時仍未清楚新型冠狀病毒的「超級帶菌者」對傳播有甚麼影響。不僅如此，較早前香港大學刊於《刺針》的研究更指出，由於未出現病徵個案已對外輸出一定數量，全球主要城市各自爆發新型冠狀病毒的情況已是無可避免。其他情況機會可能較大。\n",
            "根據現時多國以及香港的措施，都是盡量阻止源頭病人，或將外來旅客隔離 14 日觀察控制疫情。\n",
            "外媒 Vox 形容疾病爆發類似同火災，病毒是「火種」，而高風險人士則為「燃料」。當病毒感染所有高風險人士後，疫情將會慢慢減退。\n",
            "哈佛大學流行病學家 Michael Mina 接受 Vox 訪問時舉例： 2015–2016 年中美國家爆發，短時間令大部份受感染的 Zika 病毒正正是自然消失。 Zika 病毒雖然仍然存在，但已不再擴散。不過他亦表示因為科學家仍未知道哪些人感染風險最高，現時未知新型冠狀病毒怎樣自行消失。社區中對病毒呈免疫力的人，或能減低病毒傳播機會。\n",
            "現時有可能的情況，是中國國內未來已無人可再受感染，而其他國家的密切監控可令醫療人員盡快隔離治療病人。然而，此情況也絕不「理想」。因為這即代表疾病在消退前，已令不少人受感染，同時不少人因而死亡。發展中國家醫療資源不足，加上社會動盪等情況下，所受影響可能更難以想像，也更難以有效監察疫情發展。以 Zika 病毒為例，估計至 2016 年為止，就有約 162 萬人受感染。\n",
            "另一個可能性，是新型冠狀病毒疫情不會停止，而是與其他 4 種冠狀病毒一樣，成為風土病 (endemic) 。不包括新型冠狀病毒，其實仍有 4 種冠狀病毒流行，包括已出現數個世紀的 OC43 及 229E，以及 2003–4 年後發現的 HKU1 及 NL63。今次新型冠狀病毒也有機會成為類似風土病。此類病毒會在社區中持續出現，而其感染率則有機會隨季節變化而改變，難以估計。 4 種冠狀病毒一般會令患者出現傷風症狀，但嚴重者亦有可能導致肺炎，甚至死亡。哥倫比亞大學公共衛生學院流行病學專家 Stephen Morse 向 STAT 指，他想像到新型冠狀病毒有機會成為第五種冠狀病毒風土病。\n",
            "還有一個可能出現的情況，是新型冠狀病毒會變得如流行性感冒般，接季節出現，而其傷害力也會因應不同環境因素而改變。\n",
            "流感和上述 4 種冠狀病毒一般較常見於乾旱寒冷的天氣。流感專家 Richard Webby 接受 STAT 時指，假設新型冠狀病毒也有類似情況的話，相信感染數字將會在乾燥溫暖夏天回落，傳播機會大幅減少。\n",
            "較好消息是，生物學家 Michael Farzan 指新型冠狀病毒的基因譜與 SARS 相似，同樣擁有一個「分子校對系統」存在，減低複製過程出錯而出現異變的機會。相信其變異率將會比流感以及 HIV 更低，而病毒出現更高致命性的機會也會減低。以現有數據估計，新型冠狀病毒病死率約為 2% ，但有機是是因為未有計算輕微病症者而大幅高估死亡率。\n",
            "然而，即使是低病死率疾病，也有機會因其高傳染性導致大量病人死亡。以病死率相對偏低的流感為例，美國疾病控制中心就估計， 2016–2017 年期間約有 2,900 萬人出現病徵感染，約 38,000 人死亡。\n",
            "另一有參與新型冠狀病毒研究的生物學家 Andrew Rambaut 也向 STAT 指出，現時該病毒傳播性已相當高，演化上也不見病毒會出現甚麼改變，已可造成全球大流行 (pandemic) 。不過也因如此，病毒也與對上一個情況一樣，會繼續在社區中傳播，而傳染力則受多個因素，包括社區免疫力影響。傳染病學專家 Amesh Adalja 認為，今次之所以影響特別大，是因為人類首次面對此種病毒出現，未有相應免疫力對抗。下次新型冠狀病毒再次爆發時，其傳染率高低也會受今次爆發時受感染者數量影響。而更重要是，一旦疾病是以季節性循環出現，科學家則有更多時間研製疫苗，或可再下次爆發前推出\b、減低傷害。最理想的情況，是疫情會如同 H1N1 豬流感般，致命性比想像中低，但仍然以季節性疾病形式出現。\n",
            "總括而言，疫情發展取決於至少幾個因素：監察數據準確性、公共衛生政策、病毒檢測速度、治療或預防方法研發速度、個人衛生習慣和免疫力等。唯現時疫情仍屬初期，以上四個只是綜合專家意見，實際上科學家未可準確預測未來情況。科學家亦已盡快研製疫苗，但相信已難以趕得上控制今次疫情。以目前數據顯示，疫情有效受控機會已不斷減低。因此更需盡快了解疫情散播至全球的機會，令其他國家的醫療系統應對疫情爆發有所準備。另外，一旦病毒日後變為風土病或季節性疾病，醫療機關應怎樣處理，亦是另一重大問題——特別是從每年流感疫情經驗已知，一旦大眾對疫情失去戒心，則有機會導致大量原本可避免的病重或死亡個案。 \n",

            "確實，余慧明和員工陣線，已經帶來了天翻地覆的改變，今日醫護首階段罷工，在香港史上幾近史無前例，但事實上到上月 23 日，香港才確診第一宗武漢肺炎確診個案，由出現確診個案到罷工，不過 10 日，要發動罷工迫使政府封關，每一天都在跟時間競賽，「疫情來得太快太急，我哋根本無時間預備自己、預備同事，全體理事由對工運毫不了解，邊學邊做。」她憶述理事會成員利用工餘時間開通宵會議，沒有時間休息是常事，「只希望同事可以支持我哋，人多夠力量，團結一致，就可以對抗到管理層，唔好再畀佢打壓。」\n",
